      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EKidney stones are hard mineral and salt deposits that form in the kidneys when urine becomes too concentrated, allowing these substances to crystallise and stick together. They can vary in size and cause severe pain, especially when passing through the urinary tract. While genetics, dehydration, and certain health conditions contribute to their formation, diet plays a major role too. Some foods can increase levels of oxalate, calcium, uric acid, or sodium in the urine, compounds that can contribute to kidney stone formation. Being aware of these \"enemy\" foods can help those prone to stones prevent recurrence and protect their kidney health. In this article, we share foods to avoid if you have kidney stones.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E10 Foods that might be the enemy if you have kidney stones\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Spinach\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESpinach is high in oxalates, which bind with calcium in the kidneys to form calcium oxalate stones, the most common type.

Beets\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELike spinach, beets contain high oxalate levels. People who are prone to calcium oxalate stones should limit beetroot and beet juice, as regular consumption can significantly increase oxalate buildup in urine.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAyurvedic hacks can be highly effective in preventing seasonal ailments during the monsoon. According to Ayurveda, the rainy season aggravates the Vata and Kapha doshas while weakening Agni (digestive fire), making the body more prone to infections, indigestion, respiratory issues, and joint pain. Ayurveda recommends natural, holistic practices using herbs, spices, diet, and daily routines to balance these doshas, boost immunity, and protect against common monsoon ailments like colds, coughs, fevers, skin infections, and digestive problems. Read on as we share Ayurvedic hacks to help avoid ailments this monsoon.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E10 Ayurvedic hacks this monsoon to avoid seasonal ailments\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Start your day with warm water + ginger or tulsi\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDrinking warm water infused with ginger or tulsi leaves first thing in the morning helps kindle digestive fire (Agni), flush out toxins, and prevent throat infections. It strengthens the respiratory system and prepares your gut for the day ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Use triphala for detoxification\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETriphala, a mix of amla, haritaki, and bibhitaki helps cleanse the digestive system, prevent constipation, and boost immunity. Consuming it at night with warm water keeps your gut clean and strengthens your overall resistance to infections.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Apply sesame oil for abhyanga\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPerforming a warm oil massage using sesame oil (or medicated oils like Narayana Tailam) helps calm aggravated Vata, nourishes the skin, lubricates the joints, and improves blood circulation. It also acts as a barrier against skin infections caused by dampness.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Include digestive spices in every meal\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAyurveda advises adding spices like cumin, black pepper, turmeric, ajwain, and asafoetida (hing) to your monsoon meals. These enhance digestion, reduce bloating, and prevent foodborne infections, common during the humid season.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Avoid raw leafy vegetables and opt for light, warm foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERaw greens can harbour bacteria and worsen digestion during monsoon. Instead, opt for warm, cooked, easy-to-digest foods like khichdi, soups, and steamed vegetables. This helps maintain a balanced Agni and prevents gastrointestinal issues.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Drink herbal teas throughout the day\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESipping herbal teas made with ingredients like tulsi, cinnamon, cardamom, or mulethi (licorice) helps fight off colds, maintain respiratory health, and keeps the body warm and light. These teas are also calming and support immunity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Avoid daytime sleeping\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDay sleeping during monsoon can increase Kapha accumulation, slowing down metabolism and inviting lethargy, cold, and cough. Ayurveda suggests staying active during the day and resting well at night to maintain natural body rhythms.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Burn camphor or use natural incense at home\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBurning camphor or Ayurvedic herbs like sambrani in the home helps purify the air, kill germs, and uplift the mood. It also prevents mould and damp-related respiratory discomfort that are common in monsoon months.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Use turmeric with honey for immunity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMixing a pinch of turmeric in a spoon of honey and consuming it in the morning can strengthen your immune response. Both ingredients are natural antibiotics and help fight inflammation, throat irritation, and viral infections.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Avoid excessive cold or fried foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECold, oily, or deep-fried foods aggravate Kapha and dampen digestive fire, leading to sluggish digestion, colds, and sore throats. Stick to freshly cooked, warm meals with minimal oil to stay light and energised.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIncorporating simple, time-tested Ayurvedic hacks can help keep the body strong, the mind calm, and the immune system resilient throughout the damp season.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ESpiritual narcissism can be both captivating and toxic, leaving those around them feeling drained, confused, and even spiritually wounded.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe path to spiritual enlightenment is often paved with good intentions, but what happens when the pursuit of higher consciousness becomes a tool for arrogance? When spiritual practices and teachings are used to fuel the ego rather than transcend it, spiritual narcissism can take root. This phenomenon can be both captivating and toxic, leaving those around them feeling drained, confused, and even spiritually wounded.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a post shared on Instagram, fitness coach Luke Coutinho explained the meaning of spiritual narcissism. He wrote, \"A spiritual narcissist is someone who uses spiritual or religious beliefs and practices to boost their ego, gain power, control, or admiration, and often to feel superior to others. Unlike genuine spirituality, which emphasises humility, empathy, and connection, spiritual narcissism is marked by self-centeredness disguised as enlightenment.\"&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fitness coach added that spiritual narcissism is not the same as narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), which is a clinical diagnosis. It is rather a \"pattern of behaviour that can occur in anyone, especially in spiritual or religious contexts.\"\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLrwCmloOXC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Superiority complex\u003Cbr /\u003E\r\nThey act as if they are more spiritually advanced, looking down on others who don't share their beliefs or practices.

Attention-seeking behaviour\u003Cbr /\u003E\r\nThey constantly highlight their spiritual achievements (e.g., posting about meditation retreats or spiritual experiences on social media) to gain admiration.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ELactose intolerance is a common digestive condition where the body is unable to fully digest lactose, the natural sugar found in milk and dairy products. This occurs when the small intestine doesn't produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose. As a result, undigested lactose ferments in the colon, causing uncomfortable symptoms. If someone is unsure whether they have lactose intolerance, certain symptoms especially after consuming dairy, can serve as helpful indicators. Recognising and tracking these symptoms can assist in identifying the condition and guiding dietary changes or seeking medical advice. Keep reading as we discuss signs that might indicate you have lactose intolerance.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E10 Symptoms in case you're unsure if you have lactose intolerance\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Bloating\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most common signs of lactose intolerance is abdominal bloating. After consuming milk or dairy, you might notice your stomach feeling full, tight, or swollen. This is due to the fermentation of undigested lactose in the colon, which produces gas and discomfort.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Diarrhoea\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFrequent loose stools shortly after eating dairy products may point to lactose intolerance. Since the body can't break down lactose properly, it pulls water into the intestines, resulting in watery bowel movements.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Stomach cramps\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECramping or sharp abdominal pain often follows dairy consumption in people with lactose intolerance. These cramps can range from mild to severe and usually appear within 30 minutes to two hours of eating or drinking dairy.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Gas\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFlatulence is a common but often embarrassing symptom. The buildup of hydrogen and other gases during lactose fermentation in the colon can cause increased gas, leading to pressure, discomfort, and sometimes audible symptoms.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Nausea\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFeeling nauseated after consuming dairy could indicate lactose intolerance. In some cases, individuals might even feel close to vomiting, especially when large amounts of lactose are consumed on an empty stomach.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Rumbling or gurgling sounds in the stomach\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHyperactive bowel sounds or gurgling noises, especially after eating dairy, are caused by excessive gas and fluid in the intestines, signalling digestive distress associated with lactose intolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Urgency to use the bathroom\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAn urgent need to go to the bathroom soon after consuming dairy could be a red flag. The combination of cramping, bloating, and diarrhoea often creates an intense, immediate need for a bowel movement.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Constipation\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThough less common, some people with lactose intolerance experience constipation instead of diarrhoea. The altered digestion and gut motility from incomplete lactose breakdown can slow down bowel movements for some.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Fatigue or brain fog after eating dairy\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESome people report feeling unusually tired or mentally foggy after dairy consumption. While not a classic digestive symptom, this may be linked to systemic inflammation or a body-wide response to the gut imbalance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Skin breakouts or rashes\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough not always directly caused by lactose intolerance, skin issues like acne, rashes, or eczema-like symptoms sometimes flare up in people who react poorly to dairy. These signs might indicate inflammation linked to poor lactose digestion or a dairy sensitivity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you notice a consistent pattern of these symptoms after eating dairy, it's wise to consult a healthcare provider or try a short-term dairy elimination followed by a reintroduction to see if symptoms reappear.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EConstipation is a common digestive concern characterised by infrequent bowel movements or difficulty passing stools. Constipation can cause discomfort, bloating, gas and cramps. Various factors can contribute to constipation, including dehydration, low fibre intake, lack of physical activity, certain medications, and medical conditions. Understanding the underlying causes is essential for effective management.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most immediate ways to alleviate constipation is through dietary changes. Certain foods, particularly those with high fibre content can promote bowel regularity and provide quick relief. Here, we have some foods that can help you relieve constipation effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EFoods to manage constipation\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Fibre-rich foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh-fibre foods promote healthy digestion, add bulk to the stool and promote bowel regularity. Vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and Brussels sprouts are great choices. Fruits such as apples, pears, and berries are also rich in fibre, particularly when consumed with the skin. Beans and legumes, including lentils, chickpeas, and black beans, are also excellent sources of soluble fibre.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Whole grains\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhole grain products like oats, brown rice, and whole grain bread contain fibre. They may help enhance the bulk of the stool and stimulate bowel movement.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Fruits with natural laxative effects\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESome fruits contain mild laxative properties like prunes and dried plums. They contain sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that attracts water into the intestines, promoting easier bowel movements. Additionally, figs and kiwi can also help due to their high fibre content and natural enzymes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Nuts and seeds\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlmonds, walnuts, flaxseeds and chia seeds are rich in fibre and healthy fats. Including a handful of nuts or a mix of seeds in your diet to support healthy digestion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Hydrate well\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDrinking enough water helps prevent and relieve constipation. Staying hydrated helps soften the stool, making it easier to pass. Herbal teas, particularly those containing ginger or peppermint, can also aid digestion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to these dietary tips, exercising regularly helps promote digestion and stimulates digestive function.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

Some studies show benefits even with 6,000–8,000 steps, especially in older adults.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Fact: Walking more can reduce the risk of chronic diseases\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERegular walking whether it's 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 steps, can lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It also improves blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and insulin sensitivity over time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Myth: You have to walk all steps at once\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don't need to walk all 10,000 steps in a single session. Accumulating steps throughout the day like using stairs, taking short walks, or pacing during calls, has the same health benefits when spread out.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Fact: Walking improves mental health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDaily steps, regardless of the exact number, are linked to better mood, reduced anxiety, and improved cognitive function. Even brief walks during a stressful day can positively impact mental well-being.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Myth: Step count matters more than intensity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile step count is useful, intensity also matters. A brisk 30-minute walk can have more cardiovascular benefits than a slow-paced 10,000 steps. Including moderate to vigorous movement improves heart and lung health more effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Fact: Even fewer steps can be beneficial\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStudies show that walking just 7,000–8,000 steps per day can significantly lower mortality risk, especially in adults over 40. It's more important to stay consistent than to chase a specific number.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Myth: Only walking counts toward your health goals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOther activities like cycling, swimming, strength training, and yoga may not add to your step count but still offer great health benefits. A well-rounded fitness plan includes more than just walking.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Fact: Step goals can motivate consistent movement\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor many people, having a daily step goal serves as a motivational tool. Fitness trackers and step counters help build accountability and promote healthier habits over time, even if the goal varies per person.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Myth: If you miss 10,000 steps, the day is a failure\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHealth is about consistency, not perfection. Missing the mark occasionally won't undo your progress. It's better to focus on moving regularly throughout the week than stressing over a single day's step count.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Fact: Walking supports weight control and energy levels\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERegular walking, especially when combined with good nutrition and sleep, can support weight management and improve energy levels. It's a low-impact, sustainable way to stay active and burn calories.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding the facts and myths around this number helps tailor fitness routines to individual needs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EFrizziness is very common during the monsoon season due to the high humidity levels in the air. Moisture in the atmosphere causes hair to absorb excess water, swell up, and lose its smooth structure leading to frizz, puffiness, and lack of manageability. Additionally, rainwater can strip away natural oils from the scalp and hair, making it dry and more prone to breakage. While commercial products are available, many people find effective and safer relief from natural, homemade remedies that nourish the hair, lock in moisture, and restore shine. Below we share a list of homemade remedies to help reduce frizziness for monsoon.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHomemade remedies to fight frizziness this monsoon season\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAchieving and maintaining a healthy weight is a common goal for many individuals. With countless diets and weight loss strategies available, it's essential to focus on methods that are effective and safe.

These foods provide essential nutrients while keeping you full and satisfied. Reduce your intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and high-fat items. These can contribute to weight gain and are often low in nutritional value.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPortion control:\u003C/b\u003E Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portion sizes. Eating in moderation helps prevent overeating and supports gradual weight loss. Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues.

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Include muscle-strengthening exercises at least twice a week. Building muscle mass boosts metabolism and helps burn more calories, even at rest. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk during breaks, and incorporate physical activity into daily routines. Every bit of movement counts toward overall health and weight loss.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHydration and sleep\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EStay hydrated:\u003C/b\u003E Drinking plenty of water helps control hunger and supports metabolic processes.

Setting realistic targets helps maintain motivation and makes long-term success more attainable. Consult with healthcare providers, such as dieticians or nutritionists, for personalised advice and support. Join weight loss groups or find a workout buddy. Having a support system can provide encouragement and accountability.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EOthers\u003C/b\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003EIntermittent fasting:\u003C/b\u003E Intermittent fasting involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. Studies have shown it can be effective for weight loss and improving metabolic health. Common methods include the 16/8 approach, where you fast for 16 hours and eat during an 8-hour window. Behavioural therapy can help identify and change eating and activity habits.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ECertain exercises can help reduce back pain by strengthening your core, improving posture, enhancing flexibility, and relieving tension in the spine. Back pain is often caused or worsened by prolonged sitting, poor posture, or weak supporting muscles. Fortunately, you don't need a gym or a lot of time, some simple movements and stretches can be done right at your desk or in the office. These exercises not only relieve pain but also prevent stiffness and improve circulation, helping you stay more productive and comfortable throughout the workday. In this article, we share a list of exercises you can try at work today to reduce your back pain.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EExercises you can perform at work today to reduce back pain\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Seated cat-cow stretch\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESit tall in your chair with your feet flat on the floor. Inhale, arch your back slightly, and lift your chest and chin (Cow pose). Exhale, round your back, and tuck your chin to your chest (Cat pose). Repeat for 5–10 breaths. This stretch mobilises the spine and relieves tension in the upper and lower back.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Seated forward bend\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile sitting, spread your legs slightly and slowly bend forward, letting your hands reach toward the floor or your feet. Let your head hang naturally. Hold for 15–30 seconds. This decompresses the lower back and relaxes tight muscles caused by sitting.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3.

This stretch improves spinal mobility and eases back tension.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Desk shoulder rolls\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERoll your shoulders slowly backward in a circular motion for 10 repetitions, then forward for another 10. This loosens up tight shoulders and upper back muscles often affected by desk work.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Seated hamstring stretch\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESit on the edge of your chair, extend one leg straight with the heel on the floor, and toes pointing up.

Wall angels\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStand against a wall with your back flat and arms at a 90-degree angle, like a goalpost. Slowly raise and lower your arms as if making snow angels. Do 10 reps. This strengthens the upper back and shoulders and improves posture.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIncorporating these simple, office-friendly exercises into your daily routine can significantly reduce or even prevent back pain, keeping you more energised, focused, and pain-free at work.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ETrampoline workouts, also known as rebounding exercises, involve performing fitness routines on a mini trampoline or rebounder. These workouts can range from simple bouncing to high-intensity routines that incorporate squats, jumps, sprints, and even dance moves. They provide a fun, low-impact form of cardiovascular and strength training that is suitable for all fitness levels. Because the trampoline absorbs much of the impact, it's gentle on the joints while still effectively engaging various muscle groups. Trampoline workouts are considered healthy as they improve cardiovascular fitness, balance, coordination, and core strength, all while burning calories and reducing stress. In this article, we share a list of benefits you can achieve from performing trampoline workouts.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E10 Ways trampoline workouts are healthy for you\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Improves cardiovascular health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EJumping on a trampoline elevates your heart rate, making it an excellent cardiovascular workout.

Strengthens core and lower body muscles\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery bounce activates your core, glutes, hamstrings, and calves. Over time, trampoline workouts help tone and strengthen these areas, improving overall functional strength.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Burns calories efficiently\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStudies suggest that trampoline workouts can burn calories at a rate comparable to running.

Supports bone density\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe repetitive low-impact bouncing motion stimulates bone tissue without the harsh impact associated with other activities, potentially improving bone density and reducing osteoporosis risk.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Increases energy and metabolism\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe physical activity boosts circulation and oxygen flow, which can enhance energy levels and rev up metabolism.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn today's hyper-connected fast-paced world, yoga is often seen as a luxury. Social media doesn't help with the narrative where it's easy to get intimidated by impossibly bendy yoga poses. The biggest barrier to starting yoga isn't physical limitation; it's the myths and misconceptions suggesting that yoga is reserved for a select few. But yoga is much more than that, it is a timeless, inclusive practice, deeply rooted in Indian tradition. It helps harmonize the mind, body, and breath. Let's shatter some illusions and discover the inclusive practice that yoga truly is.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EDebunking the yoga myths\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Yoga is too slow or boring\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople often point out that yoga is slow and boring and hence they don't want to start something like this. They also complain that it's not fast paced to affect the required body parts. The truth is that yoga offers a wide spectrum -from calming practices to dynamic power flows. For some people, yoga is an energizing workout and for others, it's a meditative pause in chaos.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. You need to be flexible for Yoga\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYoga is not done by people who are flexible, rather yoga is done by people who want to achieve flexibility. Yoga is the journey to gradually move from your starting point to pushing the limits. The key here is patience, consistency, and compassion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Yoga isn't a real workout\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch myths generally stem from observing only one facet of this diverse discipline. Yoga can be physically demanding as any other gym workout session. Dynamic styles like Ashtanga and Power Yoga build serious strength, endurance, and cardiovascular fitness. Holding poses challenges muscles in ways that traditional weightlifting often misses, creating functional strength that translates to everyday activities. Moreover, yoga helps your most important muscle - the heart- while also focusing on your mental health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(Arpan Kushwaha is a Yoga expert at Cult)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

      "description": "In this article, we share a list of ayurvedic remedies you can try today to reduce bloating this monsoon.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EBloating during the monsoon season is a common issue, mainly due to increased humidity and weakened digestion caused by seasonal changes. According to Ayurveda, the digestive fire (Agni) weakens in monsoon due to the dampness and imbalance in Vata and Kapha doshas, leading to indigestion, gas, and bloating.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EDementia is not a specific disease, but a term used to describe a group of symptoms that affect memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily life. It is most commonly associated with older adults, but symptoms can begin earlier than many realize, a condition known as young-onset dementia when it occurs before age 65. In some cases, signs may appear as early as in a person's 30s or 40s. Since dementia in younger individuals is often mistaken for stress, depression, or burnout, early symptoms can be overlooked, delaying diagnosis and support. Recognizing the early signs is crucial for timely intervention and better management.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EDementia is not a specific disease, but a term used to describe a group of symptoms that affect memory, thinking, and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily life. It is most commonly associated with older adults, but symptoms can begin earlier than many realize, a condition known as young-onset dementia when it occurs before age 65. In some cases, signs may appear as early as in a person's 30s or 40s. Since dementia in younger individuals is often mistaken for stress, depression, or burnout, early symptoms can be overlooked, delaying diagnosis and support. Recognizing the early signs is crucial for timely intervention and better management.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ESleep apnea is a common but serious sleep disorder in which a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The most prevalent type, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), occurs when throat muscles relax and block the airway. This leads to poor sleep quality, loud snoring, daytime fatigue, and can increase the risk of conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and depression. You may be at risk if you snore loudly, wake up gasping, feel excessively tired during the day, or have a partner who notices pauses in your breathing at night. Identifying your risk factors can help in early detection and prevention. Read on as we share factors that put you at risk of sleep apnea and how to overcome these factors.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E10 Factors that put you at risk of sleep apnea &amp; how to reduce them\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Excess weight\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EObesity, especially around the neck, increases fat deposits that can obstruct breathing. Adopt a healthy diet, engage in regular physical activity, and aim for gradual weight loss. Even a small reduction in weight can significantly improve symptoms.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Neck circumference\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA larger neck (over 17 inches in men and 16 inches in women) can narrow the airway. Strengthen and tone neck and throat muscles through targeted exercises and manage overall body fat to reduce neck size.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. A Narrowed airway\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInherited traits like a narrow throat, enlarged tonsils, or adenoids can block airflow. ENT evaluation may help; in some cases, surgery or use of devices like CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) may be recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Being male\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMen are more likely to develop sleep apnea than women.

Older age\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleep apnea is more common as people age, due to muscle tone loss in the throat. While age can't be altered, good sleep hygiene and lifestyle changes can minimise the severity of symptoms.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6.

Use of alcohol or sedatives\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThese substances relax throat muscles, increasing the risk of airway obstruction. Limit or avoid alcohol and sedative medications, especially before bedtime.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Smoking\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESmokers have higher rates of sleep apnea due to increased inflammation and fluid retention in the airway.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ESome foods generally considered “healthy” might not be the best choice to start your day with, mainly because of how they interact with your body on an empty stomach. While these foods may be rich in nutrients, their high acidity, fibre, sugar content, or digestive demands can lead to issues like stomach discomfort, sluggishness, energy crashes, or poor nutrient absorption when consumed first thing in the morning. For a good start to the day, your breakfast should ideally be balanced offering protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs and gentle on your digestive system. Below we share a list of healthy foods you should avoid eating first thing in the morning.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EThese healthy foods are not the right way to start your morning\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Citrus fruits\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile citrus fruits are packed with vitamin C and antioxidants, their high acidity can irritate the stomach lining if eaten on an empty stomach. This might lead to heartburn or discomfort, especially for those with acid reflux or sensitive digestion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Raw vegetables\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERaw veggies are nutrient-dense but are also high in insoluble fibre, which can be harsh on an empty stomach. Eating them first thing in the morning might cause bloating, gas, or abdominal cramps, especially if your digestive system is not yet fully active.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Granola or muesli\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThough often marketed as healthy, many commercial granolas are high in sugar and refined oils. Starting your day with a sugar spike can lead to a mid-morning energy crash, and excessive sugar intake in the morning can disturb blood sugar regulation throughout the day.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Green smoothies\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELeafy greens like kale and spinach are healthy, but raw forms are high in oxalates and fibre.

Tomatoes\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERich in antioxidants and vitamin C, tomatoes are highly acidic. Eating them alone for breakfast can irritate the stomach lining and may contribute to gastritis or acid reflux symptoms over time, especially in people prone to digestive sensitivity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Bananas\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThough convenient and full of potassium, bananas have a high sugar content and are quite acidic. Eating one on an empty stomach can spike blood sugar levels and increase magnesium in the blood abruptly, which may disturb heart health in sensitive individuals.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Whole grains with bran\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBran-heavy cereals are rich in fibre, but eating too much insoluble fibre early in the morning without adequate hydration can cause bloating or digestive discomfort.

      "description": "This cultural approach challenges the Western idea that productivity is tied to constant alertness.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EInemuri meaning “being present while asleep,” is a unique part of Japanese culture where brief napping in public spaces like on trains, in offices, or even during meetings is socially accepted and often seen as a sign of diligence. Unlike traditional naps, inemuri isn't about escaping from work; it subtly reflects dedication, suggesting that a person has been working so hard, they've earned a moment of rest. By normalising short, mindful rest during the day, inemuri can actually boost cognitive function, creativity, emotional regulation, and overall work performance, making it a surprisingly effective productivity tool in the modern, overworked world. Keep reading as we share a list of ways Inemuri can be beneficial for you.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHealth benefits of Inemuri\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Enhances focus and mental clarity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInemuri helps the brain “reboot.” A 10–20 minute nap can restore concentration, improve attention span, and reduce the cognitive fog that builds up after long periods of work. It allows the brain to enter light sleep, which resets neural activity without causing grogginess.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Improves decision-making and problem-solving\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen mental fatigue sets in, decision-making suffers. Inemuri gives your prefrontal cortex (a key decision-making hub) a break. After even a short nap, studies show increased ability to make thoughtful, less impulsive choices.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Boosts memory and learning\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBrief naps help consolidate short-term memories into long-term storage. Inemuri acts like a “save button” for your brain, especially after taking in new information, improving recall and the ability to apply knowledge creatively.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Reduces workplace stress and burnout\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of pushing through exhaustion, inemuri acknowledges the need for rest. By taking short naps during high-stress periods, workers can release tension and reduce cortisol levels, helping them return to tasks calmer and more resilient.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Supports emotional regulation\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleep-deprived brains overreact to small frustrations. Inemuri restores emotional balance by refreshing brain regions linked to empathy, patience, and social awareness. This can lead to better communication and fewer conflicts at work.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Increases productivity without overwork\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERather than encouraging longer hours, inemuri allows people to work smarter. Short naps increase output per hour, meaning tasks are completed more efficiently without extending the workday or draining energy reserves.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Fosters a healthier relationship with rest\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInemuri challenges the toxic belief that rest equals laziness. It creates a culture where rest is respected, not shamed. This shift supports healthier sleep cycles overall and encourages boundaries between intense effort and intentional pause.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Encourages cultural acceptance of human limits\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBy making public napping acceptable, inemuri promotes self-awareness and listening to the body's signals. It reflects compassion and realism in work culture, recognising that even the most driven people need downtime.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Minimises mistakes and accidents\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFatigue is a major cause of workplace errors. Even a 15-minute nap can improve alertness and reduce slip-ups especially in fields where precision matters (like medicine, transportation, or design).\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Cultivates creativity and insight\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe semi-lucid state after a short nap is a fertile ground for fresh ideas. Many people report eureka moments or creative breakthroughs post-nap. Inemuri provides mental space where innovative thinking can emerge.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETry incorporating Inemuri in your routine today to achieve these benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ECertain diet changes can help reset and improve your sleep routine by supporting your body's natural circadian rhythm and optimising the production of sleep-regulating hormones like melatonin and serotonin. Foods rich in specific nutrients such as magnesium, tryptophan, and complex carbohydrates can help calm the nervous system, regulate blood sugar levels, and promote the release of sleep-inducing hormones. By adopting specific dietary habits, you can train your body to feel sleepy at the right time and enjoy more restorative rest. Read on as we share a list of diet changes you can make today for better sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EDiet changes that can help reset your sleep routine\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Add magnesium-rich foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMagnesium helps relax muscles and calm the nervous system, making it easier to fall asleep. Foods like spinach, almonds, pumpkin seeds, avocados, and bananas can be added to your daily meals to naturally boost magnesium levels and support better sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Eat tryptophan-containing foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETryptophan is an amino acid that aids in the production of serotonin, which converts into melatonin—the sleep hormone. Including foods like turkey, oats, eggs, dairy, and soy in your dinner can help your body wind down and get ready for bed.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Include complex carbohydrates at dinner\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EComplex carbs like sweet potatoes, brown rice, and whole grains help make tryptophan more available to the brain. They promote a slow release of energy and contribute to stable blood sugar levels throughout the night, which prevents wake-ups due to dips in energy.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4.

A light dinner with lean protein, vegetables, and a small portion of whole grains helps your body rest instead of work hard to digest food.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Add a bedtime snack with protein and carb combo\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA small snack like a banana with nut butter or yogurt with berries before bed can keep your blood sugar stable overnight and encourage melatonin production, helping you fall asleep more easily.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8.

Limit alcohol intake in the evening\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThough alcohol may initially make you sleepy, it interferes with REM sleep and can cause frequent nighttime awakenings. Reducing alcohol can lead to more restful, uninterrupted sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EThere are specific workout tips to follow during your 40s because the body begins to undergo changes like slower metabolism, reduced muscle mass, stiffer joints, hormonal shifts, and a higher risk of injury. This decade often brings increased responsibilities and stress, which can impact recovery and consistency. Hence, workouts in your 40s should focus on sustainability, injury prevention, strength building, flexibility, and cardiovascular health. With the right approach, it's possible not only to maintain fitness but to thrive, boosting energy, managing weight, and preserving bone and muscle strength for decades to come. Read on as we share a list of workout tips you can follow if you're in your 40s.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E8 Workout tips for people in their 40s\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Prioritise strength training over just cardio\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStrength training becomes crucial in your 40s to combat muscle loss (sarcopenia), maintain metabolism, and support joint health. Focus on compound movements like squats, lunges, push-ups, and deadlifts at least 2–3 times a week. This helps preserve lean muscle, burn more calories at rest, and support bone density.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Always warm up properly\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn your 40s, skipping a warm-up increases the risk of strains and joint pain. A good 5–10 minute warm-up with dynamic stretches and mobility drills (like arm circles, leg swings, or bodyweight squats) prepares your muscles and joints, increases blood flow, and enhances performance while reducing injury.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Include mobility and flexibility work\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFlexibility and joint mobility decline with age. Include yoga, Pilates, or mobility-focused stretches (especially for the hips, shoulders, and spine) in your weekly routine. This helps prevent stiffness, improves posture, and ensures that movements stay fluid and pain-free.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Focus on recovery just as much as training\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour body doesn't bounce back as quickly as it did in your 20s or 30s. Prioritise sleep, hydration, stretching, and rest days. Consider foam rolling or massage to help with muscle recovery. Overtraining can lead to inflammation, burnout, or chronic pain if not balanced with adequate rest.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Build core strength for stability\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECore stability becomes increasingly important for posture, back support, and balance. Add exercises like planks, bird dogs, and dead bugs to your routine. A strong core reduces the risk of injury and supports functional movements in daily life.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Adapt intensity, not commitment\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don't have to push harder you have to train smarter. Moderate intensity with consistent effort beats high-intensity burnout. Interval training, walking on an incline, or lighter weights with slower reps can deliver excellent results without over-stressing the body.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Listen to your body's signals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAches, pains, or fatigue should not be ignored. In your 40s, the risk of injury is higher, and ignoring warning signs can lead to long-term issues. Modify your workouts when needed and don't feel guilty about taking an extra rest day or changing intensity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E8. Balance cardio with strength and stability\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDon't overdo cardio like running or cycling while neglecting muscle training.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EA lingering cough is a persistent cough that continues for weeks after the initial illness or trigger, such as a cold, flu, COVID-19, or respiratory infection, has resolved. This type of cough can be dry or productive (producing mucus) and is usually caused by airway inflammation, postnasal drip, acid reflux, or even heightened sensitivity in the throat. While it may not always indicate a serious issue, it can be disruptive and exhausting. Fortunately, a few smart and effective hacks can soothe the throat, reduce irritation, and speed up recovery from a lingering cough. Read on as we share hacks to reduce lingering cough.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E10 Most effective hacks for a lingering cough\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Stay well-hydrated\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDrinking plenty of fluids helps thin out mucus, soothe throat dryness, and calm irritation in the airways. Warm fluids like herbal teas, broths, or warm water with lemon and honey can be especially comforting. Hydration also supports overall immune function, helping the body heal faster.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Use honey before bedtime\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHoney is a natural cough suppressant with antimicrobial and soothing properties. A spoonful before bedtime can coat the throat, reducing nighttime coughing spells and improving sleep. Mix it with warm water, turmeric, or ginger for added benefit but avoid giving honey to children under one year of age.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Elevate your head while sleeping\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleeping with your head elevated helps prevent mucus from pooling in your throat and triggering coughing, especially if postnasal drip or acid reflux is the culprit. Use an extra pillow or prop up the head of the bed slightly to keep the upper body inclined.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Inhale steam or use a humidifier\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESteam inhalation helps moisten dry, irritated airways and loosen mucus. Simply inhale steam from a bowl of hot water or take a hot shower. Using a humidifier in your room also adds moisture to the air, which can ease a dry cough, especially in air-conditioned or winter environments.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Try salt water gargles\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGargling with warm salt water a few times daily helps reduce throat inflammation, loosen mucus, and flush out irritants. This simple remedy also helps relieve the scratchiness that can trigger more coughing.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Avoid cough triggers\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECommon irritants like dust, smoke, perfumes, and pollution can worsen a lingering cough. Try to avoid these triggers, use an air purifier at home, and wear a mask when stepping outside in polluted environments to reduce further throat irritation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Sip ginger or turmeric tea\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth ginger and turmeric have powerful anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Sipping on teas made with these ingredients can help soothe the throat, reduce inflammation, and fight any remaining infection causing the cough.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Suck on herbal lozenges or natural cough drops\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELozenges and cough drops help moisten the throat, reduce coughing reflex, and provide temporary relief. Look for natural options with ingredients like eucalyptus, menthol, honey, or licorice for added soothing effects.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Do breathing exercises\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGentle breathing exercises, especially those focusing on slow and deep breaths, can help retrain the respiratory system and reduce cough reflex sensitivity.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ESeveral lifestyle and dietary factors can help boost gut health, often more effectively than probiotic supplements. A healthy gut plays a key role in digestion, nutrient absorption, immunity, brain function, and even mood regulation. When the gut microbiome is diverse and balanced, it protects against harmful bacteria, supports a strong immune system, and promotes overall wellness. While probiotic supplements can help, long-term gut health is better supported through natural and consistent practices. Read on as we share a list of factors that will help boost your gut health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EFactors that are more effective than probiotic supplements in boosting gut health\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. High-fibre diet\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFibre-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts serve as prebiotics, food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut. These fibres help diversify the microbiome and improve digestion and bowel regularity. Unlike probiotic supplements that only introduce a few strains, fibres fosters the growth of a wider range of good bacteria.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Fermented foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENaturally fermented foods like curd, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, idli, dosa, and miso are rich in live cultures. These foods introduce multiple strains of beneficial bacteria and are often better absorbed by the body than commercial supplements, which can be sensitive to heat, pH, and storage conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Staying hydrated\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWater helps flush out toxins and keeps the digestive tract moving efficiently. Proper hydration also supports the gut lining and helps transport nutrients to cells. Unlike supplements, which target specific strains, water benefits the entire digestive system.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Stress management\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChronic stress can disrupt gut flora, increase inflammation, and slow down digestion. Practices like meditation, yoga, deep breathing, and spending time in nature help lower cortisol levels and create a better environment for gut bacteria to thrive.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Regular physical activity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExercise boosts gut microbiome diversity and promotes better bowel movements. Activities like walking, swimming, or cycling increase blood flow to digestive organs and reduce inflammation benefits that probiotic capsules alone cannot provide.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Consistent sleep schedule\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EQuality sleep allows the gut to repair and balance itself. Irregular sleep disrupts circadian rhythms, which also affect gut flora. A regular 7–9-hour sleep cycle promotes hormonal balance and supports gut-brain communication more holistically than supplements.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Limiting processed foods and added sugars\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHighly processed foods and excess sugar feed harmful bacteria and yeast in the gut. Reducing junk food and switching to whole, unprocessed meals helps good microbes flourish naturally and sustainably, unlike short-term probiotic intake.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Avoiding unnecessary antibiotics\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAntibiotics kill both good and bad bacteria in the gut. Avoiding their unnecessary use and allowing natural recolonisation through a healthy diet supports long-term microbiome health, something probiotic supplements can't fully restore on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Eating a diverse diet\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA wide variety of plant-based foods helps cultivate a more diverse gut microbiome. Each type of plant fibre supports different strains of bacteria, leading to a more robust gut ecosystem than a single-strain probiotic pill.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGiving your digestive system regular breaks through intermittent fasting supports gut healing, improves bacterial balance, and reduces inflammation. This mindful eating habit trains the gut to reset and function better without external supplementation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIncorporate these habits in your routine today to boost your gut health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

These vegetables are rich in nutrients that support healthy digestion, regulate blood sugar levels, and curb hunger by promoting a feeling of fullness. Some even contain bioactive compounds that help fight fat accumulation, especially around the abdomen. By replacing high-calorie, processed foods with these fibre-rich, nutrient-dense vegetables, you not only reduce your overall calorie intake but also support the body's natural fat-burning processes, making belly fat loss more attainable. Read on as we share a list of veggies you can add to your diet to lose belly fat.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EVeggies you can add to your diet if you want to lose belly fat\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Spinach\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESpinach is incredibly low in calories but rich in fibre, iron, and magnesium. Its high water content and volume help you feel full without overeating.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAcross India, a silent health revolution is unfolding, on two wheels. Once seen as a modest mode of transport, the bicycle is regaining ground as a powerful tool for fitness, sustainability, and mental well-being. From CEOs to daily wagers, more Indians are embracing cycling not only for convenience but also for the health benefits of cycling. The World Health Organisation (WHO) supports active commuting, including cycling, as a means to reduce the risk of lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Could daily cycling be your key to a healthier and more balanced life?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ETransformative health benefits of cycling everyday\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you cycle to work, school, or the local market, this low-impact, high-reward activity offers numerous benefits that extend beyond fitness. Here's how cycling can transform your physical and mental health while contributing to a cleaner environment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Improves cardiovascular health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling is an aerobic activity that gets your heart pumping and lungs working. According to the British Heart Foundation, cycling everyday reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases by up to 50%.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Aids weight management\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EJust 30-60 minutes of cycling can burn between 300-600 calories, depending on intensity. It also boosts your metabolism, helping in healthy weight loss and preventing obesity-related conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Boosts joint health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling is gentler on the knees and joints compared to running. It's especially beneficial for those with arthritis or recovering from injury, improving mobility without high impact.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Enhances mental clarity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPhysical activity like cycling triggers the release of endorphins, natural mood lifters. It can reduce stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. A Harvard Medical School study also links cycling everyday with improved cognitive function.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Builds muscle strength\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling engages the legs, glutes, and core muscles, gradually increasing strength and endurance. Over time, it also enhances posture and balance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Strengthens the lungs\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBy improving breathing rhythm and oxygen intake, cycling enhances lung capacity. This is especially valuable in polluted urban areas, as it helps the body filter and process air more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Improves balance and coordination\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling everyday hones reflexes and stabilises the body, skills that are particularly useful for older adults to prevent falls and injuries.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Increases immunity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EModerate daily exercise like cycling supports a stronger immune system. Research by the University of Bath shows that regular cyclists have lower instances of common illnesses.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Lowers risk of chronic illness\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDaily cycling reduces the risk of conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and certain cancers. The WHO recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, which cycling easily fulfils.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Promotes environmental and economic health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChoosing a cycle over a car helps reduce CO₂ emissions, air pollution, and fuel expenses. This supports a healthier planet and saves money in the long run, an indirect but vital health benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling everyday isn't just about fitness, it's a holistic approach to living better. Backed by global health organisations and celebrated by people across economic backgrounds, it bridges health, affordability, and environmental responsibility. So, whether it's a short ride to the grocery store or a daily commute, every pedal stroke is a step toward a longer, stronger, and cleaner life.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "description": "As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity weekly to maintain health, an especially critical reminder for sedentary gamers.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIn the ever-evolving world of esports and online gaming, physical fitness has become a surprising but essential pillar of peak performance. Gaming is no longer just a hobby, it's a high-stakes profession that demands endurance, mental agility, and long hours of razor-sharp focus. According to Qoruz, India's creator economy has grown exponentially from 962,000 influencers in 2020 to over 4 million in 2024. Within this ecosystem, gaming creators alone have grown by 213%, touching 467,000. As competitive gaming rises, maintaining physical well-being is becoming crucial, not just for longevity in the field but for overall mental and emotional resilience.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the leading voices advocating this shift in mindset is Raj “Snax” Varma, one of India's top professional gamers and content creators. Known for his calm gameplay, strategic thinking, and relatable online presence, Raj Varma is more than just a competitive player. He's part of a new wave of creators blending skill with self-care. Through his content and fitness-focused platform SnaxMax, he's inspiring the next generation of gamers to treat their bodies like their most important gear.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EImportance of physical fitness for gamers\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGaming at a professional or even passionate amateur level requires more than just reflexes. Endurance, posture control, injury prevention, and mental clarity all depend on a gamer's physical health. As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity weekly to maintain health, an especially critical reminder for sedentary gamers.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ETips for improving physical health as a gamer\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Prioritise mobility and stretching\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGamers often remain in seated positions for hours, leading to tight hips, stiff necks, and weakened back muscles. Daily stretching and mobility drills, like neck rolls, hip openers, and spinal twist, can relieve tension and prevent long-term damage.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Incorporate strength training\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBasic bodyweight exercises such as push-ups, squats, and planks help build core strength, essential for maintaining posture. Gamer and influencer Raj Varma, who founded the training platform SnaxMax, credits strength training for keeping him steady during high-pressure tournaments.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Maintain cardiovascular endurance\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECardio activities like cycling, skipping, or brisk walking improve stamina and oxygen delivery to the brain, aiding focus and reducing fatigue during long gaming sessions. “When I started training properly, I noticed something shift, not just in how I felt, but how I played,” says Raj Varma.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Focus on recovery and rest\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EProper sleep and rest days are just as important as workouts. Gaming till late can disrupt circadian rhythms, but recovery is crucial. According to the CDC, adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night to maintain peak cognitive and physical function.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Eat clean, fuel right\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAvoid excessive energy drinks and processed snacks. Instead, prioritise balanced meals rich in lean protein, whole grains, fruits, and hydration. Snax emphasises that clean meals are now part of his “daily load out”, as critical to his gameplay as his gear.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Create a gamer-friendly fitness routine\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDon't aim for perfection. Small, consistent efforts, like 20 minutes of daily walking or 10-minute stretch breaks between matches, can make a lasting impact. “The grind isn't just behind the screen,” says Raj Varma, “it's about how well you recover and how clearly you can think under pressure.”\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Enhance mental clarity through movement\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERegular physical activity boosts endorphins, natural mood enhancers. This can combat gaming-induced stress, improve reaction time, and aid in sharper decision-making under competitive settings.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Be a role model for the next generation\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Snax shares, “More players are realising that fitness isn't a distraction from gaming. It's a major advantage.” His training-focused platform aims to lead by example, encouraging upcoming gamers to see success as a combination of both digital skill and physical strength.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGaming in 2025 is more competitive than ever, and with this growth comes the responsibility to care for the body that enables it all. From casual players to pro streamers, prioritising fitness is no longer optional, it's the meta. As Raj Varma rightly puts it, “You want to level up? Start with your body. When that's in sync, everything else follows.”\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

As the temperature rises, your digestive system slows down and you become prone to bloating, acid reflux and indigestion. Therefore, it becomes more important than ever to load the diet with healthy foods that are not only easier to digest but also can keep you cool this summer. Here, we have a list of summer foods that can aid in digestion and contribute to overall wellness.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ESummer foods to keep digestion healthy\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIn our fast-paced lives, we often overlook the small, consistent choices that have a big impact on our overall well-being. While long-term fitness goals and lifestyle overhauls are important, incorporating quick, daily health boosters can make a significant difference in how we feel and function. These aren't magic fixes, but time-tested habits and nutrient-rich additions that improve energy, immunity, and focus. From your morning drink to post-lunch routines, even a 5-minute tweak can be transformative. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), lifestyle interventions are among the most sustainable ways to prevent non-communicable diseases. So, why wait?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHere's where to begin\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don't need a radical overhaul to feel healthier. Start with these easy-to-adopt habits and ingredients that are backed by nutritionists and wellness experts.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Start your day with lemon water\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA warm glass of lemon water in the morning can kickstart your metabolism, hydrate your body after hours of sleep, and support digestion. Lemons are rich in vitamin C, which boosts immunity and helps neutralise free radicals. It also acts as a gentle detoxifier and can aid in clearer skin.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Add a handful of nuts and seeds\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a small handful of almonds, walnuts, or flaxseeds can give your body a good dose of healthy fats, protein, and fibre. Omega-3 fatty acids found in walnuts and flaxseeds help regulate inflammation and support brain function. According to the American Heart Association, nuts may reduce the risk of heart disease.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Include a probiotic-rich food\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour gut health influences your mood, immunity, and even weight. Yogurt, kefir, homemade pickles, and buttermilk (chaas) are excellent sources of probiotics. Including them in your daily diet supports a healthy gut microbiome, improves digestion, and may reduce bloating and gas.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Sip herbal teas between meals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of reaching for sugary drinks, sip on herbal teas like tulsi, ginger, or chamomile. They hydrate your body, soothe your digestive system, and carry antioxidant properties. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), herbal teas can also help reduce stress and promote relaxation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Add a quick 10-minute walk after meals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPost-meal walks, especially after lunch or dinner, improve digestion, regulate blood sugar, and enhance circulation. Even 10 minutes can reduce feelings of sluggishness. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend short, frequent walks to help manage weight and lower risk of chronic diseases.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Sprinkle turmeric in your meals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETurmeric contains curcumin, a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compound. Adding just half a teaspoon to your vegetables, dals, or milk can support joint health, fight cellular damage, and even improve mood. WHO recognises turmeric as one of the most potent natural compounds for managing inflammation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Prioritise one mindful activity daily\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it's deep breathing, journaling, or five minutes of meditation, taking a mindful pause improves emotional regulation and reduces stress. Chronic stress is linked with heart disease, diabetes, and poor immunity. According to Harvard Medical School, daily mindfulness practices significantly improve overall well-being and resilience.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall health boosters, when done consistently, can have a cumulative and transformative effect on your physical and mental health. From what you eat to how you move and rest, these simple daily habits support a stronger immune system, better mood, and long-term vitality.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIn a world dominated by cars, gadgets, and sedentary lifestyles, cycling offers a refreshing and sustainable change. Not only is it an eco-friendly mode of transportation, but it also supports cardiovascular health, mental wellness, and weight management. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), regular cycling can reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and even some cancers. For urban dwellers and rural commuters alike, cycling is becoming an accessible, low-impact exercise that benefits people of all ages. This article explores why adopting cycling as a lifestyle habit can contribute to better health and a safer environment for all.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EMore than just health benefits of cycling\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling isn't just fun or nostalgic. It's a practical, low-cost, and highly effective way to improve your overall well-being. Here's why you should consider pedalling more often.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Strengthens your heart\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling increases your heart rate and improves cardiovascular function. A report by the British Heart Foundation found that people who cycle regularly cut their risk of heart disease by almost 50%.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Enhances mental health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERegular physical activity like cycling helps reduce stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. It boosts endorphin production, enhances mood, and can even improve sleep quality, as supported by studies from the American Psychological Association.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Supports weight loss and management\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling burns calories without straining your joints. Even 30 minutes of moderate cycling can burn 250-500 calories depending on your intensity and weight, making it ideal for managing body fat and improving metabolism.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Reduces air and noise pollution\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChoosing a bicycle over a car helps cut down on harmful vehicle emissions, contributing to cleaner air. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) supports increased cycling in urban areas as a step toward reducing urban smog and noise pollution.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Builds muscle and bone strength\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling works your lower body, especially the quads, hamstrings, and calves. It also improves joint mobility and strengthens bones, which is particularly beneficial as we age or recover from injuries.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Improves balance and coordination\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMaintaining balance on a bicycle engages your core and stabilising muscles. This improves overall body coordination and may help prevent falls, especially in older adults.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Cost-effective and accessible\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling doesn't require fuel or a gym membership. Once you invest in a basic bicycle, maintenance is minimal, and the health benefits are long-term and cost-effective. This makes cycling ideal for students, workers, and even older individuals.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Encourages community bonding and road safety\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECities with active cycling communities report better social connections and reduced traffic congestion. Many urban planners recommend creating dedicated bike lanes to make roads safer and encourage cycling as a primary commute.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Eco-conscious habit for future generations\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBy adopting cycling today, you promote a lifestyle that conserves resources and supports global climate goals. It sets a strong example for children and contributes to a culture of sustainability and healthy living.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECycling is a safe, sustainable, and scientifically backed way to enhance physical and mental well-being. As health organisations like the WHO advocate, even moderate cycling can significantly improve your health outcomes and reduce lifestyle disease risks.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIn today's fast-paced world, stress has quietly become a chronic health hazard. While many turn to medications or therapy, ancient practices like Sudarshan Kriya offer a holistic alternative. Developed by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and popularised through the Art of Living Foundation, Sudarshan Kriya is a powerful breathing technique that combines cyclical breathing patterns with mindfulness. Scientific studies, including those by the International Journal of Yoga and Harvard Medical School, show that just 30 minutes of daily practice can significantly reduce stress, enhance immune response, and improve overall mental well-being. Here's how simple practice of Sudarshan Kriya can profoundly transform your health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHere's how Sudarshan Kriya can transform your health\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESudarshan Kriya isn't just spiritual, it's biological. Regular practice aligns breathing with the body's natural rhythms, impacting key systems including the nervous, respiratory, and endocrine systems. Let's explore the benefits of Sudarshan Kriya.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Reduces stress and anxiety\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESudarshan Kriya significantly lowers cortisol levels, the body's main stress hormone. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that regular practitioners report reduced symptoms of anxiety and improved emotional resilience. The rhythmic breathing soothes the nervous system and fosters a deep sense of calm.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Improves sleep quality\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPractising 30 minutes of Sudarshan Kriya daily can improve the quality and duration of sleep. Research from NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences) showed participants had fewer instances of insomnia and reported deeper, uninterrupted sleep after incorporating the kriya into their nightly routine.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Enhances immunity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERegular breathing exercises increase oxygenation and improve lymphatic drainage. This strengthens your body's ability to fight infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many doctors and yoga experts highlighted Sudarshan Kriya's potential in supporting respiratory function and boosting immunity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Balances emotions and boosts mood\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis kriya activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with “rest and digest” functions. It helps regulate mood swings, enhances dopamine and serotonin levels, and may aid in managing mild to moderate depression, according to research from Harvard Medical School.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Supports cardiovascular health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBreathing practices like Sudarshan Kriya help regulate blood pressure and heart rate variability. A study in Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback found participants experienced improved heart rate patterns and better circulation, which reduces the risk of heart-related diseases over time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Improves focus and clarity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERegular practice increases alpha brainwave activity, responsible for alertness and creativity. Many corporate professionals and students practise Sudarshan Kriya to improve their concentration, mental clarity, and decision-making abilities, particularly during high-stress periods.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Detoxifies the body naturally\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe kriya involves deep and rhythmic breathing, which facilitates oxygen exchange and expels toxins through breath. It also massages internal organs gently, enhancing digestion and the body's natural detox process.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Can be practised by all age groups\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether you're a teenager dealing with academic pressure, a middle-aged professional battling burnout, or a senior looking for balance, Sudarshan Kriya is safe, effective, and customisable for all age groups under proper guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBreath is the bridge between the body and mind. Just 30 minutes of Sudarshan Kriya each day can lead to long-term improvements in physical health, emotional stability, and mental clarity. With strong endorsements from global health organisations and mounting scientific evidence, this ancient technique offers a simple yet profound path to holistic well-being, one breath at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "description": "Understanding the root causes and long-term consequences is essential for preventing further health issues and ensuring better digestive and overall well-being.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EConstipation is often dismissed as a minor inconvenience, but chronic constipation can significantly impact your health. Defined as having fewer than three bowel movements per week, constipation leads to hard, dry stools that are difficult to pass. It affects approximately 22% of the Indian population, particularly women and the elderly. According to the World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO), persistent constipation can contribute to multiple complications beyond just abdominal discomfort. From haemorrhoids to mental stress, its effects are wide-ranging. Understanding the root causes and long-term consequences is essential for preventing further health issues and ensuring better digestive and overall well-being.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy constipation should not be ignored\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile occasional constipation is common, ongoing irregularity can disrupt your digestive system and affect various organs. Here's how constipation impacts the body over time. Health complications associated with chronic constipation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Haemorrhoids and anal fissures\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStraining during bowel movements puts pressure on rectal veins, leading to swollen blood vessels (haemorrhoids) or small tears in the anal lining (fissures), which can be painful and cause bleeding.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Bloating and abdominal pain\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen stool stays in the colon too long, it ferments and releases gas. This leads to bloating, cramping, and a constant sense of fullness that can reduce appetite.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Rectal prolapse\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn severe cases, chronic straining can cause the rectum to stretch and protrude from the anus. This condition requires medical intervention and may even need surgery.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Faecal impaction\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDry, hardened stool may get stuck in the intestines, causing a blockage. This is more common in the elderly and may require manual or surgical removal.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Poor gut health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EConstipation slows the movement of food through the digestive tract, affecting gut bacteria balance. A sluggish gut may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel diseases and even metabolic conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Toxic build-up\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThough controversial, some experts believe prolonged stool retention may allow toxins to reabsorb into the bloodstream, affecting liver function and causing fatigue or brain fog.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Mental health impact\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChronic constipation can cause psychological stress, anxiety, and even depression. The discomfort and embarrassment can lead to social withdrawal and lower quality of life.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Urinary issues\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn women, a full rectum can press against the bladder, causing urinary retention or incontinence. This overlap between bowel and bladder function is especially seen in pelvic floor dysfunction.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhen to see a doctor\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf constipation lasts more than three weeks, causes bleeding, or is accompanied by unexplained weight loss, consult a healthcare provider. The Indian Society of Gastroenterology recommends increasing fibre intake, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, and reviewing medications that may contribute to constipation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EConstipation is more than just an uncomfortable pause in bowel activity, it can trigger serious health complications if left untreated. The World Health Organisation (WHO) emphasises the importance of gut health as a cornerstone of overall wellness. Listen to your body's signals, maintain a balanced lifestyle, and don't hesitate to seek help when needed for long-term digestive health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EDetox diets are short-term eating plans that claim to eliminate toxins from the body, often involving periods of fasting, followed by a strict regimen of fruits, vegetables, juices, herbs, or supplements. While the body naturally detoxifies through the liver, kidneys, and digestive system, some people turn to these diets for quick weight loss or a sense of cleansing. Some may offer short-term benefits but they can also lead to harmful side effects, especially when followed for prolonged periods or without medical guidance. Below we share some of the many side effects of following detox diets.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ESome of the worrying side effects of detox diets\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Nutrient deficiency\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMany detox diets eliminate entire food groups like protein, healthy fats, or complex carbohydrates. Over time, this restriction can lead to serious nutrient deficiencies including iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and omega-3s, affecting everything from brain function to bone health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Low energy and fatigue\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESince detox diets often involve very low calorie intake, the body doesn't get enough fuel to function optimally. This can lead to extreme tiredness, weakness, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating, especially during physically or mentally demanding tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Muscle loss\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWith insufficient protein intake, the body begins to break down muscle tissue to meet its energy needs. This not only weakens the body but also slows down the metabolism, making it harder to maintain weight loss over time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Digestive issues\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EJuice cleanses and liquid-only detoxes often lack fibre, which is essential for healthy digestion. This can cause constipation or irregular bowel movements. Conversely, some detoxes with herbal laxatives may lead to diarrhoea or dependency.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Blood sugar swings\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFruit-heavy detoxes or juice-only plans can cause rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, especially for people with insulin resistance or diabetes. These fluctuations can lead to irritability, headaches, cravings, and even fainting spells.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Electrolyte imbalance\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExcessive fluid loss through detox teas or laxatives can deplete key electrolytes like potassium and sodium, which are crucial for heart rhythm, nerve signalling, and muscle function. This imbalance can be dangerous and even lead to cardiac complications.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Mental health strain\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERestrictive detox plans can lead to increased stress, anxiety, or obsessive behaviours around food. The rigid rules may contribute to disordered eating patterns or an unhealthy relationship with one's body and diet.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Dehydration\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESome detox diets act as diuretics or encourage excessive sweating, both of which can cause dehydration. Symptoms may include dry mouth, fatigue, low blood pressure, and dizziness, posing risks especially for those with existing health issues.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Temporary weight loss, quick rebound\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMost weight lost on detox diets is water weight or muscle mass. Once the diet ends and normal eating resumes, the body often regains the lost weight quickly, sometimes with added fat making the diet unsustainable and counterproductive in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Liver and kidney stress\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIronically, some detox supplements or herbs can overwork the liver and kidneys, organs responsible for natural detoxification. High doses or prolonged use of such products may lead to inflammation, toxicity, or even organ damage if not properly monitored.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you're thinking of trying a detox diet, it's best to consult a healthcare professional first. A well-balanced diet rich in whole foods, fibre, water, and regular physical activity is a safer and more effective way to support your body's natural detox systems.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAntacids are among the most commonly used over-the-counter medications to relieve heartburn, indigestion, and acid reflux. They offer quick relief by neutralising stomach acid, making them a go-to remedy for millions. But while they are effective in the short term, long-term use of antacids is a growing concern among healthcare professionals. According to the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), prolonged use of antacids, especially without medical supervision, can lead to nutrient deficiencies, altered gut function, and increased risk of kidney and bone issues. So, should you consider taking antacids for the long haul? Let's explore the science behind long-term use and what you should watch out for.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EUnderstanding how antacids work and their implications\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAntacids work by neutralising excess stomach acid, offering temporary relief from symptoms like heartburn and bloating. However, they don't treat the root cause of acid reflux or indigestion, and prolonged use can suppress natural digestive functions. Here are some key concerns and complications linked to continuous or unsupervised use of antacids.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Nutrient deficiencies\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELong-term use of antacids, especially proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can hinder the absorption of essential nutrients such as the following mentioned below. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) warns that prolonged PPI use has been linked with osteoporosis-related fractures.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Ea. Vitamin B12\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELow stomach acid affects absorption, increasing the risk of anaemia and neurological issues.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Eb. Calcium and magnesium\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EReduced absorption can lead to weaker bones and muscle cramps.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Ec. Iron\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEssential for haemoglobin, iron levels may drop over time, leading to fatigue and weakness.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Risk of kidney problems\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESome studies suggest that long-term antacid use may be associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. PPIs in particular have been shown to potentially cause the risk of following health conditions. It is advisable to undergo periodic kidney function tests if you're using antacids regularly.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Ea. Damage kidney tissues\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Eb.

Increased risk of infections\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBy suppressing stomach acid, long-term antacid use may reduce the stomach's natural defence mechanism, allowing harmful bacteria to flourish. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that reducing stomach acid can compromise your gut's immune function.&nbsp;This may include the following health risks.&nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Ea. Increase the risk of Clostridium difficile infections\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Eb. Lead to bacterial overgrowth in the gut\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Ec.

Masking of underlying conditions\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERelying on antacids for too long can mask more serious gastrointestinal disorders such as the following. If symptoms like heartburn, bloating, or nausea persist for weeks, a proper medical evaluation is crucial.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Ea.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EHerbal hacks can effectively help keep your hair smooth and silky while taming frizz, especially when humidity levels spike, like during the monsoon. Herbs contain natural oils, antioxidants, and nutrients that deeply nourish the scalp and hair shafts. Unlike chemical-laden products, herbal remedies gently restore the hair's moisture balance, seal the cuticle layer, and prevent dryness, which is often the main cause of frizz. They also promote a healthy scalp, reduce split ends, and improve texture over time. Keep reading as we share a list of herbal hacks that can ensure your hair stays smooth and silky.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E7 Herbal hacks that can ensure your hair stays smooth &amp; silky\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Aloe vera gel leave-in\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAloe vera is a hydration powerhouse. It contains proteolytic enzymes that repair dead skin cells on the scalp and act as a natural conditioner. Apply fresh aloe gel directly to damp hair as a leave-in treatment. It smoothens the hair cuticle, tames flyaways, and adds a soft sheen without making your hair greasy. Bonus: it calms scalp itchiness and dandruff too.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Fenugreek soak\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFenugreek seeds are loaded with mucilage, which acts like a natural conditioner. Soak 2 tablespoons overnight, grind into a paste, and apply it to your scalp and hair. Leave for 30–40 minutes. It detangles knots, prevents frizz, and makes the hair feel silkier with regular use.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Neem &amp; yogurt pack\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENeem has antifungal properties, and yogurt is a natural emollient. This combo works wonders if frizz is due to scalp irritation or dandruff. Grind a handful of neem leaves and mix with yogurt to make a smooth paste. Apply it to the scalp and hair, leave for 20 minutes, and rinse. It purifies the scalp and boosts hair smoothness.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Bhringraj oil massage\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBhringraj is known as the “king of herbs” for hair. Its oil deeply nourishes the scalp, strengthens roots, and enhances shine. Warm the oil and massage it into your scalp twice a week before washing. This increases blood flow, relaxes the mind, and seals moisture into the hair strands, preventing frizz from within.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Green tea rinse\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGreen tea is packed with antioxidants that improve hair elasticity. Brew a strong cup, let it cool, and use it as a final rinse post-shampoo. It smooths the hair cuticle, reduces roughness, and adds a reflective gloss, helping combat humidity-induced puffiness.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Shikakai &amp; reetha herbal wash\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EShikakai and reetha are traditional Ayurvedic cleansers. They gently clean hair without stripping natural oils. Boil both in water, strain, and use this liquid instead of shampoo. This herbal wash keeps the scalp clean and hair soft, reducing frizz over time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Henna &amp; amla conditioning pack\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHenna naturally smoothens the hair cuticle while amla adds strength and shine. Mix henna powder, amla powder, and a little curd into a paste. Apply and leave for 1–2 hours before washing. This pack conditions the hair deeply, adds a reddish tint (if henna is used pure), and tames frizz dramatically.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EConsistent use of these natural treatments creates a protective layer on the hair, locking in hydration and boosting shine, making hair more manageable and less reactive to humidity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIn a fast-paced, hyper-connected world, the pursuit of good mental health can seem overwhelming. But sometimes, it's the simplest habits that make the biggest difference. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders, it's a state of well-being in which individuals can cope with life's stresses and contribute to their community. Fortunately, several everyday practices can significantly improve our mood, reduce anxiety, and promote emotional balance. Incorporating small, intentional habits into your daily routine can be an effective, sustainable way to enhance your overall mental well-being, without waiting for a crisis to act.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ESimple daily routine can nurture mental health\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding consistency with small habits can form a strong foundation for emotional resilience and long-term psychological wellness.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Waking up at a consistent time\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA regular sleep-wake cycle stabilises your circadian rhythm, which plays a key role in mood regulation. According to the Sleep Foundation, consistent sleep patterns reduce irritability and fatigue, both of which contribute to poor mental health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Practicing gratitude\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESpending just five minutes daily to list things you're thankful for can rewire the brain to focus on the positive. Gratitude practices have been linked to increased happiness and lower rates of depression.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Spending time outdoors\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENatural light boosts serotonin levels, a brain chemical associated with mood balance. Even a short morning walk or sitting under the sun can lower stress hormones and improve your mood.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Talking to someone daily\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it's a friend, family member, or colleague, human connection is critical. Daily social interaction, even in small doses, helps lower the risk of anxiety and loneliness.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Staying hydrated\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDehydration affects cognition, energy levels, and mood. Drinking adequate water each day is an underrated but vital habit for maintaining emotional and mental balance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Eating balanced meals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBrain health is directly tied to nutrition. Including whole grains, lean protein, and omega-3 fatty acids can support neurotransmitter function and reduce mood swings.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Limiting screen time\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EProlonged screen exposure, especially on social media, can cause anxiety, sleep disruption, and low self-esteem. Try digital detox hours daily, especially before bed, to reset your brain.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Exercising regularly\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPhysical activity releases endorphins, the brain's natural mood elevators. Even 30 minutes of moderate exercise, such as brisk walking or dancing, can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Journaling\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWriting down your thoughts helps process emotions, reduce overthinking, and provides clarity. Journaling can act as a self-reflective tool, especially during stressful times.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Practicing mindfulness or deep breathing\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEven five minutes of mindful breathing or meditation can calm the nervous system. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), these techniques can improve focus, emotional regulation, and stress resilience.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGood mental health doesn't always require grand gestures or expensive therapies. Everyday habits, sleep, hydration, movement, gratitude, and connection, create a supportive ecosystem for your mind to thrive. As recommended by the World Health Organisation, promoting mental health starts with daily actions. Start small, stay consistent, and over time, these habits can transform your emotional well-being from the inside out.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

While often brushed off with over-the-counter medication, headaches can signal deeper health issues or lifestyle imbalances. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), nearly half the adult population experiences a headache at least once a year. But not all headaches are the same, some stem from stress, others from dehydration, poor posture, or underlying medical conditions. Understanding the type and cause of your headache is essential for finding effective relief.

Migraine\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMigraines are intense, throbbing headaches that may be accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and visual disturbances (auras). According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), migraines affect around 12% of the population, and managing triggers is key to prevention. Migraine triggers include the following.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Ea. Hormonal changes (especially in women)\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003Eb.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIt might not be a typical dinner-table topic, but your urine can be one of the clearest indicators of your overall health. From colour and smell to frequency and clarity, changes in your pee could signal anything from dehydration to more serious conditions like infections, liver issues, or even diabetes. According to the National Health Service (NHS) and Mayo Clinic, observing your urine is a simple way to monitor your body's inner workings. The next time you visit the bathroom, take a second look, because your pee could be trying to tell you something important.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EUrine's colour and odour can reveal vital health insights\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHealthy urine is usually light yellow and odourless. Deviations from this may point to dehydration, diet changes, infections, or medical concerns. What your pee might be saying? Here are the key signals to watch out for.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Dark yellow or amber urine\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a common sign of dehydration. If you're not drinking enough water, your urine becomes more concentrated. Make sure to drink 8-10 glasses of water daily, more in hot or humid weather.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Very pale or clear urine\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile staying hydrated is crucial, constantly clear urine could indicate overhydration, which may dilute essential electrolytes. It could also be a sign of diabetes insipidus, a rare condition where the body loses too much fluid.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Red or pink urine\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis could be caused by eating beetroot or berries, but if not diet-related, it might signal blood in the urine, a condition known as hematuria. This could point to urinary tract infections (UTIs), kidney stones, or in rare cases, cancers. Seek medical advice immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Foamy or bubbly urine\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPersistent foaminess could suggest excess protein in your urine, an early warning sign of kidney disease. This may require further investigation, especially if accompanied by swelling or fatigue.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Strong or foul-smelling urine\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile certain foods like asparagus can temporarily alter urine's odour, a consistently strong smell could indicate an infection or dehydration. Sweet-smelling urine could also suggest uncontrolled diabetes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Cloudy urine\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOften associated with UTIs, cloudy urine may contain pus, bacteria, or crystals. It may be accompanied by pain during urination or increased urgency.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Burning or painful urination\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a hallmark symptom of a urinary tract infection but may also indicate a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Don't ignore this signal, consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Frequent urination, especially at night\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you find yourself visiting the bathroom more often than usual, especially waking up multiple times at night, it might indicate issues like diabetes, urinary tract infections, or an overactive bladder.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Unusual urine colour (blue, green, or orange)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECertain medications, food dyes, or vitamins can temporarily alter urine colour. However, persistent changes, especially to orange (which may signal liver problems), should be checked by a doctor.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour pee can say more than you think, it's often the body's first signal of an underlying issue. By staying alert to colour, odour, and frequency changes, you can detect and address health problems early. According to the Cleveland Clinic, listening to these natural signs is key to preventive care. So, the next time nature calls, pay attention.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIn today's fast-paced world, it's easy to sideline sleep in favour of productivity, entertainment, or work commitments. However, failing to get adequate rest doesn't just lead to temporary fatigue. Over time, the accumulation of insufficient sleep, known as sleep debt, can take a serious toll on your physical and mental health. Sleep debt affects the body's internal systems, from brain function to immune strength, and can increase the risk of chronic diseases. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) both emphasise the critical role of sleep in maintaining overall well-being.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow sleep debt slowly drains your health\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEven small, repeated losses in sleep can compound into long-term health consequences. Here's how insufficient rest can gradually impact key bodily functions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Cognitive performance takes a hit\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleep is crucial for memory consolidation, decision-making, and alertness. Chronic sleep loss can lead to brain fog, slower reflexes, and impaired judgment, putting you at higher risk of accidents or errors at work.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Immune system weakens\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, sleep deficiency hampers the production of cytokines, proteins essential for fighting infection and inflammation. This leaves you more susceptible to illnesses, from common colds to more severe conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Hormonal imbalances emerge\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleep plays a key role in regulating several hormones. Sleep deprivation can raise cortisol (stress hormone) levels and interfere with insulin sensitivity, increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes. It can also disrupt hunger hormones; leptin and ghrelin, leading to increased appetite and weight gain.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Cardiovascular health suffers\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe American Heart Association notes that poor sleep is associated with high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and an elevated risk of heart disease and stroke. Deep sleep stages are crucial for allowing the heart and blood vessels to repair and regenerate.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Metabolism and digestion slow down\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleep debt can disturb your digestive rhythm and reduce resting metabolic rate, making weight gain more likely. It can also affect gut microbiota, which plays a major role in immunity and digestion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Mental health deteriorates\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChronic sleep deprivation is closely linked to anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. Studies show that even one night of poor sleep can affect emotional regulation. Over time, this may trigger or worsen mental health conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Skin ageing and appearance\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleep supports cellular repair and skin regeneration. When you're sleep-deprived, cortisol breaks down collagen, accelerating the appearance of wrinkles and dullness. This is why it's often called beauty sleep for a reason.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Reproductive health complications\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor both men and women, insufficient sleep can impact fertility by disrupting reproductive hormones like testosterone and oestrogen. It can also reduce libido and lower overall reproductive success.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Increased risk of chronic diseases\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleep debt is a silent contributor to several chronic diseases like obesity, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and even some cancers, as per the World Health Organisation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Daytime fatigue leads to accidents\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFatigue from sleep loss is a major contributor to road accidents, workplace mishaps, and errors in judgement, especially in high-risk professions like healthcare and transportation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleep is not a luxury, it is a biological necessity. Managing sleep debt is as important as diet and exercise when it comes to long-term health. Experts recommend at least 7-8 hours of quality sleep every night for adults. Prioritise sleep hygiene and rest to allow your body and mind to recharge and perform at their best.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ESquats are very good for us, and performing just 20 squats daily can definitely boost health. Squats are a powerful, full-body exercise that primarily targets the lower body including thighs, hips, and glutes, while also engaging the core and improving posture. Doing 20 squats a day may seem simple, but when done consistently with proper form, it can enhance strength, improve balance, and support overall metabolic health. The compound movement also stimulates key muscle groups that help with everyday activities like walking, climbing stairs, and lifting. Below we discuss the many benefits of performing 20 squats daily.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E10 Health benefits of performing 20 squats daily\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Strengthens lower body muscles\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESquats target major lower body muscles: quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Doing 20 squats daily can increase muscle tone and strength, helping improve your ability to walk, run, or climb stairs with ease and reducing the risk of leg injuries.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Improves core strength and stability\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile squats mainly work your legs, they also activate the core muscles to maintain balance and posture. Regular squatting improves abdominal and lower back strength, which contributes to better overall stability and reduced back pain.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Enhances flexibility and mobility\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPerforming squats requires hip, knee, and ankle movement, which can improve joint flexibility and mobility over time. This helps with daily movements, reduces stiffness, and supports better posture and alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Boosts metabolism\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause squats engage large muscle groups, they stimulate more calorie burning than isolation exercises. Doing 20 squats daily increases muscle mass, which in turn raises your resting metabolic rate, helping your body burn more calories throughout the day.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Aids in weight management\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen combined with a healthy diet, consistent squats help with fat burning and body shaping. The increase in lean muscle mass improves body composition, making it easier to manage or lose weight.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Improves balance and coordination\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESquats train your body to move in a controlled, balanced way. This enhances neuromuscular coordination, which not only improves exercise performance but also reduces your risk of falls and injuries in everyday life.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Strengthens bones and joints\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe downward pressure during a squat helps strengthen bones, especially in the hips and legs. Regular squatting promotes bone density and joint health, lowering the risk of osteoporosis as you age.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Promotes better posture\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESquats require an upright spine and engaged core. Practicing them daily reinforces good postural habits, strengthens back muscles, and reduces slouching, which is especially important for people who sit for long periods.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Enhances circulation and digestion\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMovement of large muscles in the lower body improves blood circulation, which supports cardiovascular health. It can also gently massage abdominal organs, aiding in digestion and reducing bloating or constipation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIn an age defined by constant stimulation and rising stress, the ancient practices of breath-work and meditation are gaining modern validation for their holistic health benefits. From calming the nervous system to improving sleep and focus, these techniques are more than just trends. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Harvard Medical School, regular breath regulation and meditation have a positive impact on physical, emotional, and psychological health. They serve as accessible, low-cost tools to improve well-being, offering a path toward better mental clarity, reduced anxiety, and even chronic disease management. But how exactly do they work?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow breath-work and meditation support mind-body health\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBreathwork and meditation aren't just feel-good rituals; they bring measurable physiological changes. These practices help regulate stress responses, enhance emotional resilience, and improve organ function.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Calms the nervous system\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDeep breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts the “fight or flight” stress response. This helps lower heart rate, reduce cortisol levels, and relax muscles.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Improves focus and mental clarity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMeditation practices, especially mindfulness, enhance the brain's ability to focus, process emotions, and make decisions. Regular sessions improve memory and concentration, as shown in multiple neurological studies by Harvard researchers.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Supports emotional stability\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth meditation and conscious breathing reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. The American Psychological Association notes that consistent mindfulness practices can significantly lower perceived stress and improve mood.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Enhances lung capacity and oxygen flow\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBreath-work trains you to breathe more deeply and efficiently. This improves oxygen delivery to tissues and enhances stamina, especially helpful for people with asthma, COPD, or sedentary lifestyles.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Lowers blood pressure\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESlower, deeper breathing can help dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure. The American Heart Association recognises breath-work as a non-pharmacological intervention for managing hypertension.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Improves sleep quality\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMeditation and breathing exercises like alternate nostril breathing or box breathing improve melatonin levels, slow down racing thoughts, and promote deep, restorative sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Boosts immunity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStudies suggest that stress reduction through meditation helps improve immune function by decreasing inflammatory markers and enhancing the body's response to infection.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Reduces chronic pain perception\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMindfulness meditation has been shown to reduce the perception of chronic pain. It changes the way the brain processes pain signals, offering relief for patients with arthritis, migraines, and fibromyalgia.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Promotes better digestion\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the body is relaxed, digestive function improves. Breathwork reduces bloating and supports gut health by promoting the production of digestive enzymes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Encourages self-awareness and positive habits\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth practices improve self-awareness, helping individuals recognise harmful behaviours and replace them with healthier routines over time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBreath-work and meditation are not just wellness buzzwords, they're essential tools for overall well-being.

      "description": "These alternatives not only quench thirst but also replenish electrolytes, improve digestion, and boost immunity, without the side effects of processed beverages.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAs temperatures rise and dehydration becomes a common concern, people often reach for soft drinks or store-bought ORS (oral rehydration solutions). While effective, many commercial drinks are packed with added sugar, artificial flavours, and preservatives. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), rehydration doesn't always require synthetic solutions, natural sources can be equally effective and healthier. From home remedies to nutrient-packed traditional drinks, India offers a treasure trove of hydrating options. These alternatives not only quench thirst but also replenish electrolytes, improve digestion, and boost immunity, without the side effects of processed beverages. Let's explore the healthiest natural substitutes you can try today.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy natural hydration is better than sugary soft drinks\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESoft drinks often contain high-fructose corn syrup and artificial additives that may worsen dehydration and spike blood sugar. On the other hand, natural beverages can restore electrolyte balance without burdening the kidneys or gut. As per WHO guidelines, hydration with clean, nutrient-rich fluids is essential, especially during illnesses like diarrhoea, heat exhaustion, or fever.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Coconut water\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA natural electrolyte-rich drink, coconut water contains potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium. It's often called “nature's sports drink” and is gentle on the stomach. Fresh coconut water hydrates the body effectively and is a great ORS alternative for both kids and adults during fever, diarrhoea, or after a workout.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Buttermilk (Chaas)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA probiotic-rich drink, buttermilk helps in digestion and replenishes fluids. Add a pinch of rock salt, roasted cumin, and mint to make it more refreshing. Chaas is widely used in Indian households, especially in summer, and is recommended for rehydration and gut health by traditional Ayurvedic practitioners.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Lemon water with salt and sugar\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA homemade version of ORS, lemon water with a pinch of salt and sugar is a simple yet powerful hydration drink. It helps balance electrolytes, provides quick energy, and is effective during heatstroke or diarrhoeal illnesses. WHO's ORS formula is based on similar proportions of sugar and salt in water.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Sattu drink\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMade from roasted gram flour, sattu mixed with water, black salt, and lemon juice is a protein-rich, hydrating summer drink. Common in Bihar and UP, it provides both energy and cooling effects, making it ideal during hot weather and long workdays.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Bael sherbet (Wood apple drink)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBael fruit is known for its cooling and digestive properties. Mix bael pulp with water, a bit of jaggery or honey, and black salt. This traditional drink not only quenches thirst but also soothes the stomach and helps prevent heat-induced illnesses.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EEver find yourself dragging through the day, relying on caffeine or sugar just to stay awake? Low energy can stem from poor sleep, sedentary habits, or nutritional gaps. But optimising your daily routine can make a huge difference. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), lifestyle choices directly affect your physical and mental vitality. Making intentional changes to your diet, movement, and sleep habits can help you feel more energised throughout the day, without the crash. Here are some practical, evidence-backed tips to naturally boost your energy levels.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EStart your day right to sustain energy all day\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour daily energy isn't just about sleep, it's shaped by your food choices, hydration, physical activity, and even how you manage stress.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Eat a protein-rich breakfast\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESkipping breakfast or having sugary cereals can spike blood sugar and leave you drained by mid-morning. Start your day with protein-rich options like eggs, oats with nuts, or Greek yogurt to stabilise energy levels.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Stay hydrated\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDehydration is a common but overlooked cause of fatigue. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), even mild dehydration can affect mood and concentration. Aim to drink 8-10 glasses of water daily, more if you're physically active.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Move every hour\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EProlonged sitting slows circulation and drains energy. Take a brisk walk, stretch, or do five minutes of light movement every hour. This helps oxygenate your brain and keep your metabolism active.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Get 7-8 hours of quality sleep\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CDC recommends adults get at least 7 hours of sleep per night. Poor or insufficient sleep leads to reduced alertness, memory lapses, and low energy. Create a consistent sleep routine with a dark, quiet, gadget-free environment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Choose complex carbs over sugar\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile sugary snacks may give you a quick high, they lead to a sharp crash later. Switch to complex carbohydrates like brown rice, whole wheat, and vegetables to provide steady, long-lasting energy.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Limit caffeine after 2 PM\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECaffeine can disrupt sleep cycles if consumed too late in the day. Try to limit your intake to mornings, and switch to herbal teas or warm water with lemon in the evening.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Take screen breaks\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStaring at a screen for hours causes digital fatigue and mental drain. Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to refresh your mind.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Practice mindfulness or meditation\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA cluttered mind can be as tiring as physical exertion. Just 10 minutes of mindfulness, deep breathing, or meditation a day can significantly boost focus and mental stamina.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Snack smartly\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you need a snack, choose energy-supporting options like bananas, almonds, or a small bowl of sprouts. Avoid processed snacks that are high in sugar or salt.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Get some sunlight\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExposure to morning sunlight helps regulate your body clock and boosts vitamin D levels, which are closely linked to mood and energy. Try to spend at least 15–20 minutes outdoors daily.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don't need fancy supplements to beat fatigue, just smarter daily choices. By adjusting your diet, sleep, and activity patterns, you can boost your energy in a sustainable way. As health experts suggest, small lifestyle tweaks lead to big long-term benefits. Start today, and give your body the balance it needs to thrive from morning to night.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EHypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is often called the “silent killer”, and for good reason. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), nearly 1.28 billion adults aged 30-79 worldwide have hypertension, and two-thirds live in low and middle income countries like India. Yet, many remain unaware of their condition until complications arise. Hypertension quietly damages the heart, kidneys, eyes, and brain, increasing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. In a world that's increasingly sedentary and stressed, it's more important than ever to understand this health threat and take preventive measures early.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy hypertension is more dangerous than it seems\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHypertension often goes undetected because it rarely presents symptoms until severe damage occurs. According to the American Heart Association, uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause irreversible organ damage. Left unmanaged, it increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and cognitive decline. Regular monitoring and lifestyle modifications are essential for early detection and effective management.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. It increases the risk of heart disease and stroke\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh blood pressure forces the heart to work harder, leading to thickened arteries and reduced blood flow. Over time, this can cause heart attacks, heart failure, and stroke, making it a leading cause of death globally.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. It silently damages the kidneys\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe kidneys rely on healthy blood vessels to filter waste. Hypertension can damage these vessels, leading to chronic kidney disease or even kidney failure, often without noticeable symptoms until it's too late.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. It can impair vision permanently\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh blood pressure can affect the small blood vessels in the eyes, resulting in a condition called hypertensive retinopathy, which can cause blurred vision or blindness.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Cognitive function can decline with age\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERecent research links long-term hypertension with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Consistently high pressure can affect brain function by damaging the brain's blood vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. It's increasingly common in younger adults\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce considered a disease of the elderly, hypertension now affects people as young as their 20s due to stress, poor diet, lack of exercise, and excessive screen time. According to India's National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), the incidence among people aged 15-49 is rapidly rising.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Lifestyle changes can dramatically reduce risks\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple steps like reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, quitting smoking, managing stress, and sleeping well can significantly lower blood pressure levels. The WHO recommends limiting salt consumption to less than 5 grams a day.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Regular check-ups are non-negotiable\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause hypertension is often asymptomatic, routine blood pressure checks are the only way to catch it early. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises adults to check their blood pressure at least once a year, or more frequently if there's a family history.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHypertension is indeed a major global health threat, particularly in countries like India where awareness and early diagnosis are lacking. Its silent nature makes it even more dangerous. The good news? It's preventable and manageable. With routine screenings, healthy living, and proper care, one can effectively reduce its impact and lead a longer, healthier life.

      "description": "While plastics offer convenience, it's crucial to understand their hidden dangers and learn how to reduce daily exposure for long-term well-being.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EPlastics have become an inseparable part of modern life, used in everything from food packaging and water bottles to kitchen utensils and toys. However, growing evidence suggests that common household plastics may be silently impacting human health. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), exposure to toxic chemicals in plastics, such as BPA, phthalates, and microplastics, has been linked to hormonal disruption, cancer, developmental issues, and metabolic disorders. While plastics offer convenience, it's crucial to understand their hidden dangers and learn how to reduce daily exposure for long-term well-being.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy plastic toxicity is a growing concern\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe toxins in everyday plastics can leach into food, water, and the air we breathe. Over time, this accumulation of chemicals can impair bodily functions. The WHO states that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in plastics affect reproductive health, immunity, and brain development. Reducing plastic use and choosing safer alternatives is key to protecting yourself and your family.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Bisphenol A (BPA) and hormonal disruption\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBPA, found in plastic bottles, food containers, and cans, mimics oestrogen and disrupts hormonal balance. According to the Endocrine Society, BPA exposure is linked to infertility, early puberty, and increased risk of breast and prostate cancer. Opt for BPA-free or glass containers to reduce this risk.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Phthalates in household items\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPhthalates, often used to soften plastics, are found in shower curtains, vinyl flooring, and even food wraps. The CDC reports that high phthalate exposure may interfere with testosterone production and increase the risk of asthma and allergies in children. Avoid plastic-wrapped foods and use natural materials where possible.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Microplastics in drinking water and food\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMicroplastics, tiny plastic particles, have been found in bottled water, seafood, and even table salt. A study by the University of Newcastle estimates that humans may ingest about 5 grams of plastic per week, the equivalent of a credit card. These particles may cause inflammation and accumulate in vital organs over time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Plastic containers and food safety\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen heated, many plastic containers release harmful chemicals into food. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) advises against microwaving food in plastic containers or storing hot food in them. Glass, ceramic, or stainless-steel alternatives are safer options for cooking and storage.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Toxic fumes from burning plastics\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBurning plastic waste at home or in the open releases dioxins and furans, highly toxic pollutants. The WHO classifies these compounds as carcinogens, known to affect liver function, immune response, and reproductive health. Always dispose of plastic waste responsibly and avoid inhaling smoke from burning plastics.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Impact on pregnant women and infants\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPrenatal exposure to plastic toxins can harm foetal brain development and immune system formation. The American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) recommends using glass baby bottles, avoiding plastic toys with soft PVC, and not heating baby food in plastic containers.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Reusing plastic bottles may backfire\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EReusing disposable plastic bottles can cause them to degrade and leach harmful substances, especially when exposed to sunlight or heat. Choose reusable bottles made of stainless steel or glass for daily hydration needs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe widespread use of plastic in homes masks its serious health hazards. With increasing evidence linking plastic toxins to chronic diseases and developmental issues, it's time to take informed steps. Switching to safer materials, avoiding heating plastics, and reducing plastic consumption can significantly lower your exposure and contribute to a healthier, toxin-free lifestyle for you and your family.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "description": "Here's how you can take charge of your hair health.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ESplit ends and hair breakage are two of the most common hair concerns, especially in India's varied climates, ranging from dry heat to humid monsoons. These issues can lead to dull, brittle, and lifeless hair, making even the healthiest scalp appear neglected. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), excessive heat styling, poor nutrition, and environmental damage are major contributors to hair breakage and split ends. But with consistent care and small changes in your daily routine, you can prevent further damage and restore your hair's natural shine and strength. Here's how you can take charge of your hair health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy prevention is better than repair\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESplit ends cannot be fixed, only trimmed. That's why it's essential to focus on prevention. Hair breakage weakens the strands from within, leading to stunted growth and frizzy texture. As per the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS), external care, a nutrient-rich diet, and limiting damage from heat and chemicals are the top three ways to maintain healthy, resilient hair.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Trim your hair regularly\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the simplest yet most effective ways to prevent split ends is to get a trim every 6 to 8 weeks. Trimming keeps the ends neat and prevents splits from travelling up the hair shaft, which causes breakage.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Avoid excessive heat styling\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDaily use of straighteners, curlers, and even hot blow dryers can strip moisture from your hair. When heat is unavoidable, always use a heat-protectant spray and opt for the lowest possible temperature setting.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Condition your hair deeply\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUse a deep conditioning treatment or a natural oil mask once a week. Ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, and shea butter provide essential moisture and nutrients that strengthen hair fibres and reduce the risk of breakage.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Stop over-washing your hair\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWashing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAs temperatures soar during Indian summers, staying hydrated becomes not just a wellness tip, but a necessity. Dehydration in hot weather can lead to fatigue, headaches, heat strokes, and serious electrolyte imbalances. While the general recommendation by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggests around 3.7 litres for men and 2.7 litres for women per day, these numbers can vary depending on age, activity level, and climate. In India's sweltering summer heat, water loss through sweating increases, and your hydration needs spike significantly. So how much is enough? Let's dive into smart hydration tips and how to tailor your intake.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChildren and seniors are more vulnerable to dehydration due to lower fluid reserves and reduced thirst sensitivity. Offer water-rich foods, encourage frequent sips, and watch for signs like dry mouth, low energy, or confusion. Always ensure they're well-hydrated before outdoor activities.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy hydration is crucial in summer\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESweating is your body's natural way to cool down, but it also leads to substantial water and salt loss. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), even mild dehydration can impair mood, memory, and performance. In peak summer months, drinking more than the regular water quota becomes essential to prevent heat-related illnesses and keep your bodily functions operating efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Follow the ‘8x8' rule\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe classic rule of drinking eight 8-ounce glasses (roughly 2 litres) is a minimum baseline. In summer, add at least 1-1.5 litres more, especially if you are outdoors or physically active.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Watch your sweat rate and activity levels\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you're working out, walking long distances, or spending time in the sun, you may lose up to 1-2 litres of water per hour. Adjust your intake accordingly, sipping water every 15-20 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Eat your water\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFoods like watermelon, cucumber, tomatoes, muskmelon, oranges, and spinach have high water content. Adding them to your daily meals not only boosts hydration but also provides essential electrolytes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Start your day with a glass of water\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou lose water while sleeping, even without realising it. Drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning can jumpstart your metabolism and compensate for overnight fluid loss.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Don't wait until you're thirsty\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThirst is a late indicator of dehydration. Keep sipping water throughout the day, even when you're indoors. Carrying a reusable water bottle helps as a visual reminder.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Keep an eye on your urine colour\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA simple hydration check: if your urine is pale yellow, you're likely well-hydrated. Dark yellow or amber urine suggests dehydration.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Avoid diuretics and sugary beverages\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETea, coffee, alcohol, and soda can dehydrate you further. If consumed, balance them with water. Opt for lemon water, coconut water, or diluted buttermilk instead.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Replenish with electrolytes\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESweating not only depletes water but also sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Natural options like coconut water, lemon-salt water, or oral rehydration solutions (ORS) can help restore balance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour daily water needs spike in the summer, especially in India's extreme heat. Listening to your body, staying consistent with fluid intake, and opting for natural hydrating foods can go a long way. Adequate hydration supports your heart, kidneys, brain, and skin.

Increases risk of depression and anxiety\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile bed rotting might start as a coping mechanism, it often worsens mental health over time. The lack of sunlight, physical activity, and engagement with life can deepen feelings of sadness, isolation, and anxiety. This can contribute to or intensify clinical depression.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Reduces cardiovascular health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing sedentary for extended periods slows circulation and can increase the risk of blood clots, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Your heart and lungs don't get the stimulation they need to stay strong and efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Contributes to weight gain and metabolic issues\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELying in bed all day lowers your metabolism and reduces calorie burn. Combined with possible comfort eating during this time, it can lead to weight gain, insulin resistance, and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Weakens immune function\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA sedentary lifestyle and disrupted sleep can impair the immune system. When you're not physically active and are under chronic stress (which bed rotting can worsen), your body produces more inflammatory markers and fewer infection-fighting white blood cells.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Causes digestive problems\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELying down for long periods, especially after meals, can slow down digestion and increase the risk of bloating, acid reflux, and constipation. Movement helps stimulate bowel function, so inactivity hampers this natural process.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Lowers self-esteem and motivation\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EProlonged inactivity often leads to guilt or a sense of failure for not being productive, which can erode self-worth. Over time, it can become harder to find the motivation to re-engage with work, hobbies, or even basic self-care.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Strains relationships\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAvoiding social interactions while bed rotting can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from friends and family. As communication dwindles, relationships may suffer, further increasing feelings of loneliness and detachment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Increases risk of bedsores and circulation issues\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn extreme cases where someone lies in bed nearly all day without moving, the pressure on the skin and tissues can cause bedsores (pressure ulcers), especially on the hips, heels, and back. Poor circulation can also lead to swelling and numbness in the limbs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen bed rotting becomes a frequent behaviour rather than an occasional break, it may negatively impact both physical and mental health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIn today's competitive world, long hours, tight deadlines, and constant multitasking have become the norm. But beneath the surface of professional success, work-related stress is silently damaging our health. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), chronic stress is a global health epidemic that can contribute to a wide range of physical and mental disorders. It can lead to insomnia, weakened immunity, high blood pressure, and even heart disease. Mental health professionals warn that if work stress is ignored, it may gradually affect productivity, relationships, and quality of life. Understanding its impact is the first step to reclaiming our health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow work stress affects your mind and body\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWork stress doesn't just stay in the workplace, it spills into every aspect of your life. It activates the body's “fight-or-flight” response, triggering hormonal changes that affect both emotional and physical well-being. The American Psychological Association (APA) notes that chronic stress alters brain chemistry, disturbs sleep cycles, impairs digestion, and may contribute to anxiety and depression.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Triggers hormonal imbalance and anxiety\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EConstant deadlines and pressure to perform raise cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone. Over time, this imbalance may lead to irritability, anxiety, and emotional fatigue. Studies published by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) show that elevated cortisol levels are linked to increased risk of mood disorders and memory impairment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Increases risk of cardiovascular disease\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWork stress has been identified as an independent risk factor for heart disease. According to the British Heart Foundation, job strain, defined as high demands with low control, increases the likelihood of high blood pressure and cardiovascular issues, especially when paired with sedentary behaviour and poor dietary habits.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Weakens immune function\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStress impairs the body's immune response, making one more vulnerable to infections, frequent colds, and slower wound healing. The Cleveland Clinic highlights that chronic stress can reduce lymphocyte production, a key element of the immune defence system.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Leads to digestive problems\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen stressed, the body diverts energy away from digestion. As a result, you may experience indigestion, acid reflux, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Research by the Harvard Medical School points out a strong gut-brain connection, where stress significantly influences gastrointestinal health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Disturbs sleep and recovery\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWork stress often causes insomnia or disrupted sleep patterns. Poor sleep not only reduces productivity but also increases irritability, weakens immunity, and hampers decision-making. The Sleep Foundation confirms that stress is one of the top contributors to chronic sleep disturbances.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Affects relationships and emotional health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECarrying work-related tension home can strain relationships and erode personal time. The Mental Health Foundation (UK) emphasises that stress can lead to withdrawal, mood swings, and communication issues, increasing the risk of social isolation and burnout.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ETips to manage work stress effectively\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Set realistic goals and break big tasks into manageable steps\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E2. Take regular breaks, 5-10 minutes every hour helps reset focus\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E3. Practice mindfulness, deep breathing, or yoga to calm the nervous system\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E4. Maintain a healthy diet and avoid excessive caffeine or processed foods\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E5. Ensure 7-9 hours of sleep every night to aid recovery\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E6. Build a support system, talk to colleagues, friends, or a counsellor\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E7. Limit screen time post-work to reduce mental clutter and promote relaxation\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWork stress is inevitable, but its impact on health doesn't have to be. By recognising the signs early and adopting healthy coping strategies, we can safeguard both our minds and bodies. As global health agencies reiterate, addressing stress proactively isn't just a luxury, it's a necessity for long-term wellness. After all, no job is worth your health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

The WHO lists cardiovascular disease as the number one cause of death linked to obesity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Type 2 diabetes\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExcess fat reduces the body's sensitivity to insulin, leading to insulin resistance and elevated blood sugar levels. According to the International Diabetes Federation, India is home to over 77 million diabetics, and obesity is a primary contributor.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Certain cancers\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EObesity is associated with higher risks of breast, colon, endometrial, and kidney cancers. Fat cells produce excess oestrogen and inflammation-causing agents, which can stimulate the growth of cancer cells.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Joint problems and osteoarthritis\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExtra body weight puts more pressure on joints, particularly the knees, hips, and spine.

Mental health issues\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EObesity is closely linked with depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The social stigma and internalised body dissatisfaction can severely affect emotional well-being and quality of life.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Reduced immunity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChronic inflammation caused by excess fat can weaken your immune response, making it harder for your body to fight infections, including respiratory illnesses like COVID-19.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Digestive and hormonal problems\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EObesity can cause acid reflux, gallstones, and hormonal imbalances, including PCOS in women, which affects fertility and menstrual health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ESudden weather changes, from a warm afternoon to a chilly evening or dry heat to unexpected humidity, can leave your immune system confused and vulnerable. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), such fluctuations can trigger respiratory infections, seasonal allergies, and even flare-ups of chronic conditions like asthma or arthritis. With India experiencing increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, especially during the transition between seasons, it's vital to protect your health with daily immunity-boosting practices. Whether you're battling monsoon sniffles or dry cough from summer dust, these expert tips can help you build a stronger shield against seasonal ailments.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy fluctuating weather lowers immunity\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour body's immune system thrives on stability. Weather changes force it to adapt rapidly, weakening its defences. Sudden drops in temperature or rising humidity levels can increase your exposure to viruses, bacteria, and allergens. As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), boosting immunity through lifestyle changes, diet, and adequate hygiene is crucial to maintaining good health during unpredictable weather shifts. Below mentioned are eight effective tips to boost your immunity during changing weather.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Stay hydrated with immunity-friendly drinks\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWater helps flush out toxins and keeps your mucous membranes moist, making it harder for viruses to enter your system. Include warm herbal teas like tulsi, ginger, and turmeric for additional antibacterial benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Prioritise sleep and rest\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPoor sleep weakens your immune response. Aim for 7-8 hours of restful sleep, especially during season changes, to allow your body to repair and prepare against pathogens.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Add vitamin C and zinc to your diet\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECitrus fruits (like oranges and lemons), bell peppers, and amla are rich in vitamin C. Nuts, seeds, and legumes provide zinc, a key nutrient for immune cell function.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Practice good personal hygiene\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWash hands frequently, avoid touching your face, and bathe regularly to keep infections at bay. Use hand sanitisers when outside, especially during monsoon or flu season.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Keep your surroundings clean and dry\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHumidity can promote fungal growth and bacterial infections. Ensure your living spaces are well-ventilated and free from dampness, especially during the rainy season.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Exercise moderately and regularly\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPhysical activity improves circulation and promotes immune cell movement throughout the body. Yoga, brisk walking, or light indoor workouts during extreme weather are ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Eat seasonal, freshly cooked foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAvoid raw or stale food during weather transitions.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ETwo of the well-used treatments for infertility-IUI and IVF-each have diverse approaches depending on your own individual medical history, diagnosis, and unique qualities.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EIUI\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIntrauterine Insemination, or IUI, is normally the initial course of action in a couple diagnosed with unexplained infertility, slight male factor infertility, or mucus disorder in the cervix. With an IUI procedure, washed and concentrated sperm is inserted into the uterus at ovulation. This maximises the likelihood of sperm reaching and fertilising the egg. IUI is less invasive and less costly than IVF, and typically less medication is needed. Cycle success rates are lower than IVF, though, at 10-20% depending on age and condition. Most couples take more than one cycle to become pregnant, and it can prove to be emotionally and financially demanding in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EIVF\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) involves the removal of eggs from ovaries, insemination of eggs with sperm in the laboratory, and transfer of a resultant embryo into the uterus. IVF applies to patients having blocked fallopian tubes, severe male infertility, endometriosis, or when other therapy has failed. Although more costly and intrusive, IVF is more likely to succeed, particularly in women under the age of 35. Technologies like genetic testing and freezing embryos also render IVF a flexible treatment for most. These technologies enable couples to improve their odds of a healthy pregnancy, prevent genetic illness, and plan for future family expansion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUse of IUI versus IVF would depend on several factors such as age, diagnosis, duration of being infertile, and the economy. Young people with fewer fertility complications are perhaps best served by beginning with IUI. Others with more significant fertility complications or older people could try skipping the expense of IUI and proceeding straight to IVF in the expectation of greater success. Patients with time-sensitive fertility concerns, such as diminished ovarian reserve, may also benefit from moving directly to IVF.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, consulting a fertility specialist is necessary to determine the best approach to treatment for your case. Individualised treatment, informed choice, and emotional support are critical to confidently navigating your fertility process. Also, support groups or counselling may be helpful, as the psychological impact of infertility and its treatment can be profound. Proactive measures, self-education, and relying on professional advice can turn a difficult experience into a brighter one.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(Dr. Puneet Rana Arora, Gynaecologist &amp; IVF Expert, CIFAR, Gurugram)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAsthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide, including a growing number of people in India. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), asthma can be controlled and managed effectively by avoiding exposure to triggers and following a medical treatment plan. Common asthma triggers include allergens, pollutants, cold air, stress, and respiratory infections. For asthma patients, prevention is just as important as treatment. Understanding what causes flare-ups and making small adjustments in your surroundings and lifestyle can significantly reduce symptoms. Here are simple and practical ways to avoid common asthma triggers and breathe easier every day.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ETips to manage asthma triggers\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom household dust to seasonal pollen, asthma triggers often lurk in the air we breathe. But with awareness and timely action, most of these triggers can be avoided or minimised. Learning to identify and eliminate them from your immediate environment is key to keeping asthma attacks at bay. Below are some effective and easy-to-follow strategies for asthma trigger prevention.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1.

Avoid carpets and heavy drapes, which collect dust easily.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Avoid exposure to smoke and pollution\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESmoke from cigarettes, incense sticks, candles, and outdoor pollution can worsen asthma symptoms. Avoid areas with high traffic, wear a mask outdoors during pollution spikes, and consider using an air purifier at home.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Manage pet allergens wisely\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you're allergic to pet dander, keep pets out of bedrooms and off furniture. Bathe and groom pets regularly, and wash your hands after handling them. Use HEPA filters to reduce airborne pet allergens.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Control humidity and mould growth\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDamp conditions encourage mould growth, which can trigger asthma. Keep humidity below 50% using a dehumidifier, fix water leaks promptly, and clean mouldy surfaces with a bleach solution or vinegar.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Be mindful of seasonal pollen\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPollen from trees, grasses, and weeds can aggravate asthma. During high pollen seasons, keep windows closed, avoid outdoor activities early in the morning, and change clothes and shower after being outside.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Avoid strong odours and chemical irritants\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPerfumes, cleaning agents, paints, and room fresheners often contain chemicals that irritate airways.

Keep your kitchen and home pest-free\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECockroach droppings and body parts are asthma triggers. Keep food covered, dispose of garbage daily, and use non-toxic pest control methods. Regularly clean cabinets and corners where pests may hide.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Stay up-to-date on vaccinations\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERespiratory infections like the flu can exacerbate asthma. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), yearly flu vaccines and timely pneumonia shots help reduce complications in asthma patients.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Manage stress and anxiety\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStress and strong emotions can cause shortness of breath or even trigger asthma attacks. Practice deep breathing, yoga, meditation, or regular exercise to stay emotionally balanced and relaxed.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Recognise food-related triggers\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor some people, foods containing preservatives like sulphites (found in dried fruits and processed foods) can trigger asthma. Maintain a food diary if you suspect any dietary triggers and consult your doctor.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EPrevention begins with awareness and lifestyle changes\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAsthma management goes beyond medication, it involves creating a safe and supportive environment.

From work stress to social pressures, our minds deal with a constant stream of stimuli. However, nurturing mental wellness doesn't always require dramatic interventions or therapy alone. Simple daily habits, when consistently practised, can help strengthen emotional resilience, uplift mood, and reduce anxiety. The World Health Organisation (WHO) highlights that integrating healthy behaviours into your routine can significantly improve mental wellbeing. Whether it's mindful breathing, getting sunlight, or limiting screen time, small lifestyle choices go a long way. Here are some easy-to-follow habits to boost your mental health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EEveryday actions that strengthen your mental health\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEven small efforts, when done daily, can rewire your brain toward positivity and better stress management.

Start your day with mindfulness\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBegin each morning with a few minutes of deep breathing, meditation, or simply sitting in silence. Mindfulness reduces cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and increases focus throughout the day.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Stay physically active\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the Mayo Clinic, regular exercise releases endorphins, natural mood lifters. Even a 20-minute walk daily can help decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Eat mood-boosting foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA balanced diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables helps stabilise mood. Fermented foods like yoghurt and kefir support gut health, which is closely linked to mental health via the gut-brain axis.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Prioritise sleep\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe National Sleep Foundation states that adults need 7-9 hours of quality sleep to maintain mental equilibrium. Poor sleep can worsen anxiety, lead to irritability, and lower cognitive function.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Limit social media and screen time\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EConstant digital exposure can lead to comparison fatigue, reduced self-esteem, and disrupted sleep. Schedule “screen-free” hours each day to give your brain a break.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Stay socially connected\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETalk to a friend or loved one, even a short call can help combat feelings of loneliness. Human connection is a powerful buffer against mental health struggles.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Keep a gratitude journal\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWriting down three things you're grateful for each day rewires your brain to focus on positives. This practice has been linked to increased happiness and emotional resilience.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Practise deep breathing during stress\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen stress strikes, slow, deep breaths can activate your parasympathetic nervous system, lowering heart rate and calming your mind. Try the 4-7-8 technique or box breathing.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Declutter your space\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA tidy environment promotes a sense of control and calm. The act of cleaning or organising also creates a sense of accomplishment, boosting dopamine levels.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Engage in a hobby\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether it's painting, cooking, dancing, or gardening, doing something purely for enjoyment relaxes the mind and improves self-esteem.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E11.

There is no shame in asking for help, it's a step toward healing.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMental wellness doesn't require a major life overhaul, it starts with intention and consistent action.

In fact, multiple health organisations, including the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the American Psychological Association (APA), endorse regular physical activity as an effective component of depression treatment. Moreover, group exercise classes, walking clubs, or simply jogging with a friend can help build social connections, another crucial aspect in overcoming depression.

      "description": "According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EChoosing healthy food is often considered a sign of discipline and self-care. But when this desire turns into an obsession, it might be something more serious, orthorexia nervosa. Unlike other eating disorders that focus on the quantity of food, orthorexia is an unhealthy fixation on the quality and purity of food. While not officially recognised by the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), growing awareness among psychologists and nutritionists worldwide suggests that orthorexia is a rising concern, especially in health-conscious societies. So how do you know if you're eating healthy, or crossing the line?\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EUnderstanding orthorexia and how it differs from clean eating\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOrthorexia starts with good intentions, avoiding processed foods, sugar, or additives, but escalates into an unhealthy obsession. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), orthorexia often involves rigid rules, food-related anxiety, and social isolation. While clean eating promotes balance, orthorexia lacks flexibility, causing stress, malnutrition, and emotional distress despite appearing “healthy” on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. You obsessively read nutrition labels\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it's wise to understand what goes into your food, orthorexic individuals may spend hours scrutinising every label, ingredient, and sourcing detail, often rejecting food not meeting self-imposed purity standards.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. You avoid entire food groups without medical reasons\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECutting out gluten, dairy, or carbs without allergies or intolerances may be a red flag. Orthorexia can lead people to eliminate foods not because of symptoms but based on misinformation or fear.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Eating “clean” gives you a sense of superiority\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFeeling morally “better” than others for your food choices is another sign. Orthorexia can create a divide between “good” and “bad” eaters, increasing social judgment and personal guilt around food.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. You feel anxious when “healthy” food is unavailable\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople with orthorexia often experience anxiety, guilt, or distress if they have to eat outside their dietary rules, such as at social events, family meals, or restaurants.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Your food rules affect your relationships\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESkipping gatherings or being overly rigid about where and what you eat may indicate that orthorexia is impacting your quality of life and isolating you socially.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. You spend excessive time planning meals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a significant part of your day revolves around planning, sourcing, or preparing food with perfect standards, it may be more than just a healthy habit.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. You ignore hunger cues to stick to food purity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EListening to your body is essential for well-being. People with orthorexia often ignore hunger or fatigue if they can't find food that meets their standards, prioritising purity over nourishment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. You're underweight or facing nutrient deficiencies\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIronically, orthorexia can result in undernourishment. Eliminating too many foods might lead to deficiencies in protein, iron, B12, and healthy fats, impacting your overall health despite “eating clean.”\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhat to do if you think you have orthorexia\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your eating habits are driven more by fear than by nourishment, it's time to pause. Seek help from a psychologist, dietitian, or a specialist in eating disorders. According to NEDA, early intervention improves recovery outcomes. Mindful eating, therapy, and balanced nutrition can help you reclaim a healthy relationship with food, body, and life.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOrthorexia blurs the line between wellness and obsession. While being mindful of food is admirable, it should not control your happiness or isolate you. A truly healthy eater embraces flexibility, balance, and emotional well-being. If your eating habits are starting to limit your joy, reach out, because health is not just what you eat, but how you live.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAs temperatures soar across India during summer, our bodies experience a natural increase in internal heat, often leading to dehydration, fatigue, indigestion, and skin issues. According to Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, summer aggravates the Pitta dosha, the energy responsible for heat, metabolism, and transformation in the body. To maintain balance, Ayurveda recommends specific cooling foods that help pacify Pitta, hydrate the system, and keep you energised throughout the hot months. Backed by holistic wisdom and now supported by nutrition science, these foods can be easily included in your daily routine for a more refreshing and healthier summer.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy Ayurvedic cooling foods matter in summer\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAyurveda believes food is medicine, and every season demands dietary adjustments. In summer, cooling and hydrating foods soothe the overheated body and prevent seasonal ailments. These foods balance your doshas, boost immunity, and improve digestion. The Ministry of AYUSH&nbsp;recommends seasonal diets aligned with Ayurvedic principles for better health and wellness during extreme weather conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Coconut water\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENaturally sweet and packed with electrolytes, coconut water is considered a “Pitta-pacifying” drink. It cools the body, prevents dehydration, and aids digestion. It's also rich in potassium and magnesium, making it perfect for summer hydration.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Amla (Indian gooseberry)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA powerhouse of Vitamin C, amla detoxifies the body and boosts immunity. Its cooling nature makes it effective in reducing body heat and improving skin health. Have it raw, as juice, or in the form of chyawanprash.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Buttermilk (Chaas)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELight, probiotic-rich, and cooling, buttermilk improves digestion and prevents bloating caused by heat. Seasoned with cumin and coriander, it enhances its detoxifying and soothing properties. Ayurveda recommends it as a daily post-lunch drink during summer.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Sabja seeds (basil seeds)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESabja seeds, soaked in water, swell into a gel-like texture and are known to reduce body heat. Often used in sherbets and coolers, they aid digestion, reduce acidity, and act as natural body coolants.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Cucumber\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECrisp, hydrating, and alkaline, cucumber is one of the best summer vegetables. Ayurveda classifies it as a cooling food that soothes the stomach, hydrates cells, and helps eliminate toxins. It's ideal as a salad or juice ingredient.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Mint leaves (Pudina)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPudina is a classic cooling herb that stimulates digestion, clears nasal congestion, and brings down internal heat. It can be used in chutneys, buttermilk, or infused in water for an aromatic summer detox drink.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Watermelon\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis juicy fruit is 90% water and rich in antioxidants like lycopene. It reduces inflammation, quenches thirst, and prevents heatstroke. Ayurveda encourages its consumption in moderation and on an empty stomach for best results.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Fennel seeds (Saunf)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFennel seeds have a sweet, cooling effect on the body. A fennel infusion or simply chewing fennel seeds post meals can ease digestion, reduce acidity, and lower Pitta-related imbalances.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Gulkand (rose petal jam)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMade from fresh rose petals and sugar, Gulkand is a traditional Ayurvedic coolant. It cools the digestive tract, relieves acidity, and prevents mouth ulcers. One spoon daily can keep internal heat in check.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Lauki (bottle gourd)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOften overlooked, lauki is a hydrating vegetable with high water content and cooling qualities. It helps reduce high blood pressure and body heat. Consuming it as juice or lightly cooked curry is beneficial in summer.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAyurveda offers a time-tested guide to adapt your diet seasonally for optimal health. These cooling foods are not just delicious but also therapeutic, helping you manage summer heat naturally. By incorporating them into your daily meals, you'll feel lighter, refreshed, and more balanced. Let your summer plate reflect ancient wisdom for modern wellness. Eat cool, stay cool.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "description": "Here's a comprehensive guide to simple and effective water purification methods you can use at home or during emergencies.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAccess to clean drinking water is essential for maintaining good health and preventing waterborne diseases. Yet, millions across the world, including in parts of India, rely on sources that may be contaminated with bacteria, viruses, parasites, or harmful chemicals. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), unsafe drinking water contributes to over half a million diarrhoeal deaths each year. Ensuring water is properly purified before consumption is vital for safe usage, especially during monsoons or in areas with poor sanitation. Here's a comprehensive guide to simple and effective water purification methods you can use at home or during emergencies.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy water purification is crucial for health\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EContaminated water can cause diseases like cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and hepatitis A. Even clear-looking water may harbour invisible pathogens or chemicals. Purification removes or kills these harmful agents, making water safe for drinking, cooking, and hygiene. Whether you're using municipal supplies, wells, or stored tank water, purification ensures health protection for you and your family.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Boiling is the simplest and most effective method\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBoiling water for at least 1–3 minutes kills most bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It's an ideal method during emergencies or when you suspect contamination. Let it cool naturally and store in a clean, covered container. WHO recommends boiling as a reliable household water treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Use of water purifiers (RO, UV, UF)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EModern water purifiers use Reverse Osmosis (RO), Ultraviolet (UV), or Ultrafiltration (UF) technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERO filters out heavy metals, chemicals, and dissolved salts.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUV kills microorganisms by destroying their DNA.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUF removes bacteria and some viruses but doesn't eliminate dissolved salts.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChoose a purifier based on your water source, groundwater, borewell, or municipal supply.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Chlorination for large-scale or emergency use\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChlorine is a powerful disinfectant used by civic bodies to treat water. At home, you can use chlorine tablets (as per instructions) for stored water in emergencies. It's especially useful during floods or natural disasters. However, avoid overuse and ensure proper dosage to prevent side effects.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Solar disinfection (SODIS)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn rural or resource-limited areas, solar disinfection can be a lifesaver. Fill transparent plastic bottles with water and leave them in direct sunlight for 6-8 hours. UV-A rays and heat work together to kill pathogens. This method is endorsed by WHO and is low-cost and sustainable.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Use of ceramic or gravity-based filters\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECeramic filters or gravity-based filters are good non-electric options. They trap bacteria and sediments through microporous membranes. Some models also include activated carbon to improve taste and remove odour. They're ideal for rural homes or areas with electricity issues.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Activated carbon filtration\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EActivated carbon filters can reduce chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and improve taste. Though they don't kill pathogens, they are excellent when used in combination with other purification methods. Many household water filters use carbon as a secondary purification layer.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Distillation for removing heavy metals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDistillation involves boiling water and collecting the steam back as liquid, leaving most contaminants behind. It's effective for removing heavy metals like lead and arsenic but consumes more energy. It's a practical solution when dealing with chemical contamination.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Proper water storage practices\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPurified water can get contaminated if not stored correctly. Always use clean, covered containers made of food-grade plastic, stainless steel, or glass. Avoid dipping unclean hands or utensils into the container. Wash storage vessels frequently to maintain hygiene.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESafe water is the cornerstone of good health. While advanced purification systems are available, traditional methods like boiling or solar disinfection still play a vital role in emergencies or rural settings. Understanding and practising water purification at home ensures your family is shielded from waterborne illnesses. When in doubt, purify, and protect your health, one drop at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EDiet changes can significantly help reduce gut issues, and what we eat for dinner plays a crucial role in that. The gut is home to trillions of bacteria that influence digestion, immunity, inflammation, and even mental health. Poor food choices, especially at night, can lead to bloating, indigestion, acid reflux, or disrupted sleep. Choosing gut-friendly foods for dinner supports smoother digestion and allows the body to rest and repair the digestive tract overnight. In this article, we share a list of foods you can add to your dinner if you have gut issues.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EAdd these foods to your dinner routine today if you have gut issues\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Steamed vegetables\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELightly steamed veggies like carrots, zucchini, spinach, and pumpkin are easier to digest than raw ones. Cooking breaks down fibre and makes nutrients more absorbable, while still providing essential vitamins and minerals. These vegetables are gentle on the stomach and help feed beneficial gut bacteria.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Ginger\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGinger has natural anti-inflammatory and gas-relieving properties. Adding fresh ginger to soups, dals, or stir-fries during dinner can ease bloating, support digestion, and prevent nausea. It's especially helpful if you suffer from gas or slow digestion at night.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Plain yogurt\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERich in probiotics, plain yogurt helps replenish good bacteria in the gut. Including a small portion of unsweetened yogurt with dinner can aid digestion and support gut balance.

      "description": "Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EKombucha, a fizzy fermented tea, has emerged as a popular health beverage across the globe. Touted as a natural probiotic, kombucha is often linked to improved digestion, better gut health, and even immune support. Made by fermenting sweetened tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), this ancient drink has been consumed for centuries. But does it really deliver on its health promises, especially for the gut? According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other studies, kombucha may play a supportive role in gut microbiome diversity. Let's explore the science behind this fermented favourite.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow kombucha may support gut health\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EKombucha contains natural probiotics and bioactive compounds that may help balance gut bacteria and enhance digestion. During fermentation, beneficial bacteria and organic acids are produced, which can aid the gut microbiome. According to a review published in Frontiers in Microbiology, fermented foods like kombucha can positively influence gut flora, which is essential for nutrient absorption, immune function, and overall digestive well-being.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Rich in natural probiotics\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fermentation process produces several strains of live beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Acetobacter. These probiotics may help restore the balance of gut flora, especially after antibiotic use or poor dietary habits. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to better digestion, reduced inflammation, and even mental well-being. However, the quantity and strains vary by brand and brew method.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. May help with digestion\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EKombucha contains enzymes and organic acids like acetic acid and gluconic acid, which may assist in breaking down food more efficiently. Anecdotal evidence and some early studies suggest that regular consumption of kombucha may alleviate bloating, gas, and indigestion by supporting the body's natural digestive processes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Antioxidants that promote gut lining health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGreen or black tea, the base for kombucha, is rich in polyphenols and antioxidants. These compounds can protect the gut lining from oxidative stress and inflammation. Damage to the gut lining is often associated with leaky gut syndrome, food sensitivities, and autoimmune responses, making antioxidant support beneficial for long-term gut health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Supports immune function via the gut\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout 70% of your immune system resides in your gut. A healthy gut microbiome can help modulate immune responses. The probiotics in kombucha may help maintain this balance, reducing your susceptibility to infections and inflammatory responses. While more human clinical trials are needed, the existing data is promising.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. May aid in the prevention of gut dysbiosis\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGut dysbiosis, or an imbalance in gut microbes, has been linked to several conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), obesity, and even depression. Regular intake of fermented foods, including kombucha, may help prevent or correct such imbalances. A study in Nutrients (2021) reported that probiotic-rich foods could improve symptoms in individuals with mild digestive disorders.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Potential prebiotic effect\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile kombucha is primarily known for probiotics, it may also contain small amounts of prebiotics depending on its ingredients. Prebiotics are plant fibres that feed good bacteria. Ingredients like ginger or fruit add-ins in kombucha may enhance this effect, offering additional gut support.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Things to consider before consuming\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDespite its benefits, kombucha is not suitable for everyone. Unpasteurised kombucha can pose a risk for pregnant women, individuals with weakened immune systems, or those sensitive to caffeine or alcohol. Additionally, many commercial versions contain added sugars, which can negate its health benefits. Always read labels and consult a healthcare provider, especially if you have pre-existing conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EKombucha offers potential gut health benefits, largely due to its probiotic content and natural fermentation. While more large-scale human studies are needed, current evidence supports its role as a gut-friendly beverage when consumed in moderation. For optimal results, pair kombucha with a fibre-rich diet and other fermented foods. As always, individual needs vary, consult a doctor before making it a daily habit.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "description": "Here's how smokers and alcohol users can naturally cleanse their systems and boost their overall health.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ETobacco and alcohol use are two of the most common lifestyle choices that negatively impact the body's vital organs, especially the liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys. While quitting is the best option, the recovery and detoxification process can be supported naturally. Detox doesn't mean extreme fasting or relying on fancy juices, it involves helping the body eliminate toxins through the right foods, hydration, herbs, and lifestyle changes. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), supporting the body's detoxification systems is essential in substance abuse recovery. Here's how smokers and alcohol users can naturally cleanse their systems and boost their overall health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy detox matters for tobacco and alcohol users\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol and nicotine leave behind a trail of toxins that accumulate in the liver, lungs, and bloodstream. Over time, these can impair organ function, reduce immunity, and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Natural detox methods can help clear these harmful substances, support organ regeneration, and replenish essential nutrients depleted by prolonged smoking and drinking.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Hydration is your first medicine\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWater is crucial for flushing out toxins. Aim for at least 8–10 glasses a day. You can also drink detoxifying liquids like lemon water, coconut water, or cucumber-infused water. For alcoholics, hydration helps rehydrate the body and supports liver function. Smokers benefit as water helps clear tar and toxins from the lungs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Load up on antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol and cigarette smoke deplete your body of essential antioxidants like vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene. Include berries, citrus fruits, spinach, beetroot, carrots, and tomatoes in your daily diet. These foods help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation caused by toxic exposure.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Milk thistle for liver repair\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMilk thistle is an age-old herbal remedy known to support liver health. The compound silymarin found in milk thistle has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help regenerate liver cells. It's especially beneficial for alcohol-related liver damage. Always consult a doctor before adding supplements to your routine.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Steam inhalation and breathing exercises for lung detox\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESmokers can benefit from regular steam inhalation with essential oils like eucalyptus or peppermint to clear lung congestion. Additionally, practicing breathing techniques like pranayama or deep diaphragmatic breathing can improve lung capacity and help expel residual toxins.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Green tea and herbal infusions\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGreen tea is rich in catechins and other antioxidants that help boost liver function and remove toxins. Other herbal teas like dandelion root tea, ginger tea, or turmeric tea support digestion, reduce inflammation, and assist detox pathways.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Eat fibre to cleanse the gut\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol irritates the gut lining and alters gut flora, while smoking impacts nutrient absorption. Eating fibre-rich foods like oats, whole grains, flaxseeds, and leafy greens can promote healthy bowel movements and support gut detoxification. A healthy gut also supports immunity and mood regulation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Sweat it out with regular exercise\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPhysical activity increases circulation, boosts metabolism, and promotes sweating, a natural detox pathway. Cardio, brisk walking, or yoga help smokers improve lung function and support alcoholics in liver healing. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exercise also helps reduce cravings and improves mental health during recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Cut out processed foods and sugar\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth smokers and alcohol consumers should reduce intake of processed foods, sugary snacks, and refined carbs. These stress the liver and gut and increase inflammation. Opt instead for clean, home-cooked meals rich in proteins, healthy fats, and whole grains.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Sleep is vital for recovery\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EQuality sleep is the body's natural time for healing. Nicotine and alcohol often disturb sleep cycles, but focusing on 7-8 hours of rest per night helps repair tissues, reset hormones, and support cognitive function during detox.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDetoxifying from alcohol and smoking requires patience, consistency, and lifestyle adjustments. While no remedy is a substitute for quitting, these natural strategies can accelerate the body's healing process and reduce the risk of long-term damage. Always consult a healthcare provider when planning a detox, especially if you're undergoing withdrawal or treatment. Your body deserves a fresh start, nourish it well.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAbnormalities on your hands can sometimes suggest underlying health concerns because the skin, nails, joints, and circulation in your hands are closely linked to internal systems like cardiovascular, nervous, metabolic, and immune functions. Subtle changes in color, texture, swelling, or nail shape can be early indicators of conditions like nutrient deficiencies, thyroid disorders, liver disease, or even autoimmune issues. Since the hands are so vascular and visible, they often show signs of internal imbalances sooner than other parts of the body. In this article, we outline various abnormalities of the hands and what they might indicate to.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003E10 Abnormalities on your hands that may suggest health concerns\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ESalt is an essential part of our diet, helping maintain fluid balance, support nerve function, and regulate blood pressure. However, modern diets, particularly processed and packaged foods, have dramatically increased our daily salt intake beyond recommended levels. While excessive salt is widely known for contributing to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, recent studies have begun linking high sodium intake to mental health conditions. From increased anxiety to cognitive impairment, the effect of salt on the brain is becoming a growing concern. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), reducing salt intake is crucial not just for heart health, but for overall well-being.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow excess salt could influence your brain and mood\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour brain is highly sensitive to chemical changes in the body. Consuming too much salt may affect hormones, blood pressure, and inflammation, each of which can impact your mental health. Research is emerging that suggests a high-sodium diet could worsen symptoms of depression, anxiety, and even increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Triggers inflammation in the brain\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExcessive sodium has been linked to increased inflammation throughout the body, including the brain. A 2021 study published in Nature Neuroscience found that inflammation caused by high salt intake can impair neurons, especially in regions like the hippocampus that control mood and memory.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Reduces blood flow to the brain\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EToo much salt can lead to hypertension, which narrows blood vessels and restricts blood flow to the brain. Over time, this can cause cognitive decline, memory issues, and may even contribute to the development of dementia. The American Heart Association warns that uncontrolled blood pressure is a silent but significant contributor to brain damage.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Impacts the gut-brain axis\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA high-salt diet can disrupt the gut microbiota, which in turn affects the gut-brain axis—a communication pathway between your digestive tract and brain. An imbalance in gut bacteria has been associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. According to research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the gut microbiome plays a critical role in regulating mood and mental clarity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. May elevate cortisol levels\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESalt influences the body's hormonal balance. A study from Hypertension journal showed that high sodium intake can increase cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone. Elevated cortisol has been linked with anxiety, irritability, and even depressive episodes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Can disturb sleep patterns\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh salt consumption may lead to poor sleep quality, either by causing dehydration or increasing blood pressure overnight. Poor sleep is a well-known trigger for mental health issues, including irritability, low mood, and reduced concentration.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Possibly linked with neurodegeneration\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEmerging research has shown that excessive salt intake could accelerate the risk of Alzheimer's disease. A 2020 study published in Cell suggested that high salt disrupts nitric oxide production, a compound essential for healthy blood vessels in the brain. Reduced nitric oxide impairs brain function and is associated with neurodegenerative conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Increases the risk of mood disorders\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople consuming high-sodium diets are more prone to experiencing mood fluctuations. Though the evidence is still evolving, studies from the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry note a possible correlation between high salt diets and an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile salt is vital in moderation, excessive intake poses serious risks beyond physical health, it can compromise brain function and mental well-being. Experts from the WHO recommend keeping salt intake under 5 grams per day. Reducing processed foods and choosing fresh, whole ingredients is a practical first step toward safeguarding both your heart and your mind.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "description": "Recognising these patterns is the first step toward prevention and effective migraine management. These are the most common triggers of migraine in summers.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EFor migraine sufferers, summer isn't always sunshine and happiness. Rising temperatures, intense humidity, and shifting routines can all become silent triggers. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and studies published by the American Migraine Foundation, environmental factors such as heat, dehydration, and bright light can exacerbate migraine episodes, particularly in warmer months. Understanding these seasonal triggers is essential for individuals who experience recurrent migraine attacks. By identifying and avoiding specific summer-related stimuli, people can reduce both the frequency and severity of migraines, leading to better control and an improved quality of life during the hottest months of the year.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy migraines get worse in summer\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESummer heat can influence neurological and vascular systems, increasing the risk of migraines. Sudden weather changes, sun exposure, and poor hydration may lead to dilated blood vessels, a known contributor to migraines. According to the National Headache Foundation, these environmental factors often intensify the condition. Recognising these patterns is the first step toward prevention and effective migraine management. These are the most common triggers of migraine in summers.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Dehydration\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESweating more in the heat without replenishing fluids can lead to dehydration, a top migraine trigger. Even mild dehydration can cause headaches. Always carry water, and increase intake of fluids, especially when outdoors.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Excessive sun exposure\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBright sunlight and high UV rays can overstimulate the brain's visual cortex. Prolonged exposure can lead to photophobia (light sensitivity) and trigger migraines. Sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and limiting time outdoors during peak hours are essential.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Heat and humidity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh temperatures combined with humidity can cause your body to overheat, disturbing internal temperature regulation and increasing the risk of migraine. Stay in cool environments and use fans or air-conditioning to reduce impact.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Skipping meals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESummer routines often lead to irregular eating. Skipping meals causes blood sugar levels to drop, a common migraine trigger. Eat light but balanced meals every 3-4 hours to maintain energy and avoid crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Sleep disturbances\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELonger days can disrupt the body's sleep-wake cycle, especially if you're staying up late or waking earlier. Poor or irregular sleep is directly linked to migraine episodes. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep daily.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Caffeine and cold drink overuse\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECold coffees, sodas, and energy drinks may seem refreshing but often contain caffeine and sugar, both of which can aggravate migraines. Sudden intake or withdrawal from caffeine can also contribute to headaches.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Strong smells and allergens\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESummer often brings stronger odours, perfumes, sweat, pesticides, or chlorinated pool water, all of which can trigger migraines in sensitive individuals. Also, increased pollen and pollution can worsen sinus inflammation, another migraine pathway.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ETips to manage summer migraines\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple changes like staying hydrated, regulating sleep, and protecting yourself from extreme heat and sunlight go a long way. With vigilance and preventive care, those prone to migraines can enjoy a more comfortable and pain-free summer season.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Maintain a migraine diary to track specific seasonal triggers\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E2. Use cooling face towels and stay indoors during high-heat hours (12-4 pm)\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E3. Eat hydrating foods like cucumbers, watermelon, and yoghurt\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E4. Avoid sudden exposure to air conditioning after extreme heat\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E5. Keep sunglasses and an umbrella handy when outdoors\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E6. Limit screen time to avoid light-triggered headaches\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E7. Try relaxation techniques like meditation or breathing exercises to reduce stress\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile migraines can feel unpredictable, recognising and managing summer-specific triggers can make a substantial difference. When in doubt, always consult a healthcare provider for personalised guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EIn a world where long hours of sitting dominate our routines, from working at desks to binge-watching shows, standing is emerging as a powerful yet simple way to boost health. Research supported by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and American Heart Association suggests that prolonged sitting is a risk factor for obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Incorporating more standing into daily life can help counter these risks and promote better overall well-being. If you want to improve your energy levels, posture, and longevity, it's time to rethink your relationship with standing. Here's why standing matters more than you think.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy standing more is crucial for health\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe human body was designed for movement, not for sitting for extended periods. Standing encourages better blood circulation, engages muscles, and burns more calories than sitting. According to the WHO, physical inactivity is a leading risk factor for global mortality. Let's explore the major health benefits of standing.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Reduces risk of heart disease\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe American Heart Association states that prolonged sitting increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Standing intermittently during the day helps regulate blood pressure and improves heart health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Helps maintain a healthy weight\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStanding burns more calories compared to sitting. Studies show that standing for three hours a day can burn over 100 extra calories, helping in weight management over time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Improves blood sugar levels\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter meals, standing or walking can help reduce blood sugar spikes. Research published in the Diabetologia journal found that standing and light activity after eating significantly lower post-meal blood sugar levels.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Enhances posture and reduces back pain\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESitting for long periods can lead to poor posture and chronic back pain. Alternating between sitting and standing improves spinal alignment, strengthens core muscles, and reduces the risk of back problems.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Boosts energy and mood\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStanding promotes better circulation and oxygen flow, helping you feel more energised. A study published by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that employees who used standing desks reported less fatigue and improved moods.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Supports longevity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EResearch suggests that people who sit less live longer. An Australian study published in the British Medical Journal indicated that reducing sitting time could add years to life expectancy.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Improves muscle strength and balance\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStanding activates muscles in the legs, core, and back. Over time, this builds strength, improves balance, and reduces the risk of falls, especially among older adults.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. May lower cancer risk\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESome studies have linked prolonged sitting with an increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as colon and breast cancer. Standing and incorporating light activity can help in reducing these risks.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9. Enhances productivity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStanding during work can boost focus, alertness, and productivity. Companies that encourage standing meetings often report faster decision-making and improved team dynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E10. Improves digestion\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESitting for long stretches can compress abdominal organs and slow digestion. Standing, especially after meals, supports better digestive health and reduces bloating.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E11. Encourages a more active lifestyle\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you stand more, you are more likely to move more, whether it's stretching, walking, or fidgeting. This contributes to an overall more active lifestyle, essential for maintaining good health.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EStanding may seem simple, but it can have profound effects on your health. From protecting your heart to enhancing mental well-being, the benefits are well-documented by organisations like the WHO and the American Heart Association. By making small changes, like standing during phone calls or meetings, you can take a big step toward a healthier, more active life.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EMovement can significantly improve the quality of life for seniors by enhancing physical health, mental well-being, and overall independence. As people age, maintaining an active lifestyle helps counter the natural decline in muscle mass, balance, and flexibility. Movement whether through walking, stretching, dancing, or light exercise keeps joints mobile, supports cardiovascular health, boosts mood through endorphin release, and sharpens cognitive function. It also plays a crucial role in preventing chronic diseases, reducing the risk of falls, and improving sleep. In this article, we outline in detail the many benefits of exercising for seniors.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHere's how exercising boosts health in seniors\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Enhances mobility and flexibility\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERegular movement helps seniors maintain joint flexibility and muscle function, which is essential for daily activities such as getting dressed, cooking, or walking. Gentle stretching, yoga, or tai chi can preserve range of motion and reduce stiffness, making it easier to remain independent.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Reduces risk of falls\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExercise improves balance, coordination, and leg strength, which directly lowers the risk of falls—a leading cause of injury among the elderly. Activities like balance training and walking help strengthen the core and stabilising muscles, creating a stronger foundation for safe movement.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Improves cardiovascular health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEngaging in moderate aerobic activities like walking, swimming, or cycling helps keep the heart strong and blood vessels healthy. This reduces the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke, allowing seniors to enjoy more energy and stamina in their daily lives.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4.

Supports cognitive function\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExercise increases blood flow to the brain, which may help preserve memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Studies suggest that regular movement can slow cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia, helping seniors stay mentally sharp and engaged.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Strengthens muscles and bones\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWeight-bearing activities like walking, light strength training, or resistance band workouts stimulate muscle growth and bone density. This reduces the risk of osteoporosis, frailty, and age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia), making seniors more resilient to injury.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Improves sleep quality\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMovement helps regulate the body's circadian rhythms and reduces symptoms of insomnia. Seniors who are physically active during the day often experience deeper, more restful sleep at night, which is vital for overall health and recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Aids in chronic disease management\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExercise can help manage conditions like arthritis, diabetes, and high cholesterol by improving circulation, reducing inflammation, and stabilising blood sugar levels. Movement is a powerful tool that complements medical treatments and often reduces the need for medication.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E9.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol consumption is common in many cultures, often associated with social gatherings and celebrations. However, regular or excessive intake can have serious consequences for the body, affecting multiple organs and systems. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions. Even moderate drinking can lead to long-term health risks, including liver disease, cardiovascular issues, and mental health disorders. Understanding how alcohol affects the body can help individuals make informed decisions about their drinking habits and safeguard their health for the future.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow alcohol affects your body over time\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol impacts nearly every system in the body, from the brain to the liver, the heart, and even the immune system. The effects can vary depending on the amount, frequency, and pattern of drinking.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Liver damage\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe liver is primarily responsible for metabolising alcohol. Excessive drinking can lead to liver inflammation, fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis. Over time, this impairs the liver's ability to filter toxins from the blood, resulting in serious, often irreversible damage.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Brain and mental health issues\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol affects brain function, impairing communication pathways and altering mood, behaviour, and coordination. Long-term consumption can lead to cognitive decline, memory problems, depression, and anxiety. Heavy drinking has been linked to an increased risk of dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases, as highlighted by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Heart complications\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile some earlier studies suggested that moderate alcohol intake might be heart-protective, newer research from the American Heart Association states that alcohol increases the risk of high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy, stroke, and arrhythmias. Binge drinking in particular can severely strain the heart and lead to sudden cardiac events.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Weakened immune system\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol weakens the immune system, making the body more vulnerable to infections such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. Chronic drinkers are particularly susceptible to illnesses, and recovery times from infections tend to be longer due to impaired immune responses.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Digestive system disturbances\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol can cause inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to conditions such as gastritis, ulcers, acid reflux, and pancreatitis. It also interferes with the absorption of essential nutrients like vitamin B12, folate, and thiamine, increasing the risk of malnutrition over time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Increased cancer risk\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen. Alcohol consumption is linked to an increased risk of cancers, including those of the mouth, throat, oesophagus, liver, breast, and colon. Even low to moderate consumption can elevate cancer risk.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Impact on reproductive health\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn men, heavy alcohol use can lower testosterone levels and cause erectile dysfunction. In women, it can disrupt menstrual cycles and increase the risk of infertility. Pregnant women are advised to completely avoid alcohol, as it can cause foetal alcohol spectrum disorders, affecting a baby's physical and mental development.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol intake affects almost every system in the body, often with serious health consequences. Moderation is crucial, and for some, complete avoidance is the safest option. If you choose to drink, it is important to understand the risks and drink responsibly. Consulting a healthcare provider can also help guide healthier lifestyle choices based on your personal health profile.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "description": "Understanding its causes and recognising early symptoms is crucial to preventing this fatal infection and seeking timely medical help.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ERabies is a deadly viral disease that affects the central nervous system, ultimately leading to death if left untreated. Caused by the rabies virus, it is typically transmitted to humans through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, most often a dog. Despite being entirely preventable through vaccination and early intervention, rabies continues to claim thousands of lives, especially in Asia and Africa. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), rabies causes approximately 59,000 deaths every year. Understanding its causes and recognising early symptoms is crucial to preventing this fatal infection and seeking timely medical help.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ERecognising rabies early can help save lives\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe symptoms of rabies often appear after an incubation period of one to three months but may vary. Initially, the disease may resemble the flu, but as it progresses, neurological symptoms begin to dominate. Recognising the early and advanced symptoms can help in seeking urgent care. Below are key symptoms and known causes associated with rabies infection.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Fever and headache\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEarly signs mimic those of many viral infections. The infected person may experience fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. These flu-like symptoms can last for several days before progressing.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Pain or tingling at the site of bite\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most characteristic early signs of rabies is unusual tingling, itching, or burning sensation at the site of the animal bite or scratch. This may be the first indicator that the virus is affecting the nerves.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Anxiety and confusion\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the virus begins to invade the central nervous system, psychological symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, and confusion may appear. Mood changes and restlessness can also be common.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Difficulty swallowing and hydrophobia\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERabies causes painful spasms in the throat muscles, making it extremely difficult to swallow. This often results in a fear of drinking water, known as hydrophobia – a hallmark sign of rabies.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Excessive salivation\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDue to the inability to swallow, individuals with rabies often exhibit increased saliva production, resulting in drooling or frothing at the mouth.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Hallucinations and paralysis\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn its advanced stages, rabies can lead to hallucinations, delirium, insomnia, and partial paralysis. Eventually, the patient may slip into a coma, followed by death if not treated in time.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECauses of rabies\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you or someone you know is bitten by an animal, seek medical help immediately to prevent this deadly infection.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Animal bites\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most common cause of rabies is a bite from an infected animal. In developing countries, stray dog bites account for up to 99% of rabies transmission to humans, according to the WHO.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Scratches or open wounds\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEven without a bite, rabies can be transmitted if infected saliva comes into contact with a person's open wound or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth).\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Inhalation of infected droplets (rare)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn extremely rare cases, rabies has been transmitted in laboratory settings through aerosolised virus particles, particularly among researchers.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Organ transplantation\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough exceedingly rare, rabies has been documented to spread through organ or tissue transplants from undiagnosed infected donors.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Exposure to bats and wild animals\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn many developed countries, bat bites are a leading source of rabies. Raccoons, foxes, and skunks are also known carriers of the virus.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERabies is an entirely preventable disease, yet it remains fatal if not treated before symptoms appear. The key lies in awareness, recognising symptoms early and understanding how the virus spreads. Immediate wound care, post-exposure prophylaxis, and animal vaccination are vital.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "description": "Below are mentioned eight natural remedies to reduce mucus in lungs.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EMucus in lungs is a common issue, especially during respiratory infections, seasonal changes, or exposure to pollution. While mucus plays a protective role by trapping pathogens and irritants, excess buildup can lead to congestion, coughing, and breathing difficulty. Natural remedies can help loosen, thin, and expel mucus without the side effects of medication. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), lifestyle modifications, hydration, and certain herbs can effectively support lung health. If you're looking for gentle, home-based ways to clear your chest and breathe easier, here are some natural remedies to try.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ENatural remedies to relieve lung congestion\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting rid of mucus naturally involves thinning it, boosting circulation in the chest, and encouraging drainage. While medications are available, home remedies offer supportive care and work best for mild cases. As per the American Lung Association, practices such as steam inhalation, hydration, and certain herbal teas can help. Below are mentioned eight natural remedies to reduce mucus in lungs.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Stay well-hydrated\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDrinking plenty of fluids helps thin mucus, making it easier to cough up and expel. Aim for 8-10 glasses of water daily. Warm fluids like herbal teas and broths are especially soothing for the throat and chest.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Try steam inhalation\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInhaling steam helps open the airways and loosens thick mucus. Add a few drops of eucalyptus or peppermint oil to hot water and breathe in the vapour for 5-10 minutes. The Mayo Clinic recommends this method for temporary relief from chest congestion.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Use a warm compress on the chest\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EApplying a warm compress or heating pad to your chest can boost blood flow, loosen mucus, and reduce discomfort. This technique is also commonly used in chest physiotherapy to aid mucus drainage.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Consume ginger and turmeric\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGinger has natural anti-inflammatory and decongestant properties. Drinking ginger tea or chewing raw ginger can soothe the airways. Turmeric, rich in curcumin, helps fight inflammation and infection. A pinch of turmeric in warm milk or water can act as a natural expectorant.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Practice postural drainage\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis involves lying in specific positions to drain mucus from different areas of the lungs. For example, lying flat on your back with a pillow under your hips allows gravity to aid mucus movement. The American Lung Association advises combining this with controlled coughing for best results.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Gargle with salt water\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it won't clear deep lung mucus, gargling helps reduce throat irritation caused by mucus dripping down from the sinuses. Mix half a teaspoon of salt in warm water and gargle 2-3 times a day.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Eat mucus-clearing foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EInclude foods like garlic, onion, chilli peppers, and pineapple in your diet. These foods have enzymes and compounds that naturally break down mucus and support lung function. Avoid dairy, as it may thicken mucus for some individuals.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Do breathing exercises\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDeep breathing or pursed-lip breathing increases lung capacity and encourages mucus clearance. It also helps oxygenate the body better. The British Lung Foundation recommends breathing techniques for managing chronic lung conditions naturally.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExcess mucus can make you feel heavy-chested and fatigued, but natural remedies can provide relief and improve breathing. Staying hydrated, using heat, and practising breathing techniques can all support lung cleansing. If symptoms persist beyond a week or include fever and wheezing, consult a healthcare provider.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "description": "Below are some of the most common dietary culprits that may be making your acid reflux worse.",
      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EAcid reflux, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a common digestive disorder that causes a burning sensation in the chest, often referred to as heartburn. It occurs when stomach acid flows back into the oesophagus, irritating the lining. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), diet plays a significant role in triggering or alleviating acid reflux symptoms. Certain foods weaken the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) or increase stomach acid, making reflux more likely. Identifying and limiting these dietary culprits is key to managing acid reflux and maintaining a healthy digestive system.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EIdentifying triggers is the first step toward lasting relief\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile over-the-counter medications can offer temporary relief from acid reflux, long-term management often begins in the kitchen. Some foods and drinks act as direct irritants or relax the valve that keeps stomach acid where it belongs. By knowing what to avoid, individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease can significantly reduce flare-ups and discomfort. Below are some of the most common dietary culprits that may be making your acid reflux worse.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Spicy foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChillies, hot peppers, and spicy sauces can irritate the oesophageal lining and worsen acid reflux. Capsaicin, found in chilli peppers, is known to slow the digestion process, which can increase the chances of reflux. The Cleveland Clinic suggests people with GERD limit or avoid spicy dishes altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Citrus fruits and juices\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile fruits like oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits are packed with vitamin C, their high acidity can trigger reflux symptoms. Citrus juices can increase the stomach's acidity and lead to a burning sensation. Opt for non-citrus fruits like bananas and melons, which are gentler on the digestive system.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Tomatoes and tomato-based products\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETomatoes are naturally acidic and often worsen acid reflux. Foods like pasta sauce, ketchup, and pizza can aggravate symptoms. According to the American Gastroenterological Association, people with gastroesophageal reflux disease should limit their intake of tomato-based foods to reduce flare-ups.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Chocolate\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EChocolate contains caffeine, theobromine, and fat, all of which can relax the lower oesophageal sphincter and encourage acid to escape into the oesophagus. Even small amounts can cause issues for sensitive individuals. White chocolate, though caffeine-free, still contains fat and should also be consumed cautiously.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Fried and fatty foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh-fat foods delay stomach emptying and put pressure on the LES. This includes fried snacks, creamy sauces, full-fat dairy products, and red meat. A diet rich in unhealthy fats is linked to increased acid reflux. The Harvard Medical School recommends choosing grilled, steamed, or baked options instead.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Caffeinated drinks\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECoffee, tea, and energy drinks stimulate acid production and can relax the lower oesophageal sphincter. Even decaffeinated coffee has been reported to cause reflux in some individuals. Limiting caffeine intake can go a long way in reducing discomfort.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Carbonated beverages\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESodas and fizzy drinks can cause bloating, which increases abdominal pressure and encourages acid to flow upward. Additionally, most carbonated beverages are acidic in nature. Replace these with still water or herbal teas like chamomile or ginger, which may help soothe the digestive tract.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E8. Alcohol\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlcohol can relax the LES and stimulate acid production in the stomach. Wine, beer, and spirits, especially when consumed on an empty stomach, are known to aggravate acid reflux symptoms. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises moderation or avoidance of alcohol in people with digestive issues.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDiet plays a pivotal role in managing acid reflux, and identifying personal triggers is key to long-term relief. While medications can help, lifestyle and dietary changes offer sustainable solutions. If you suffer from frequent heartburn or digestive discomfort, consider limiting or eliminating these foods. Always consult a healthcare provider for personalised advice and to rule out more serious underlying conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EMouth ulcers, also known as canker sores, are small, painful lesions that develop in the mouth or at the base of the gums. Though usually harmless, they can make eating, drinking, and even talking uncomfortable. These ulcers can result from various causes, stress, hormonal changes, minor injuries, or vitamin deficiencies. While most ulcers heal on their own within 1-2 weeks, natural remedies can speed up recovery and ease discomfort. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other global health bodies, adopting proper hygiene and dietary practices can prevent recurrence. Here's how you can naturally treat and manage mouth ulcers at home.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ENatural remedies to cure mouth ulcers\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENatural treatments for mouth ulcers focus on soothing inflammation, reducing pain, and promoting tissue repair. These home-based solutions often come without side effects and are easily accessible in Indian households. According to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, small lifestyle changes and gentle remedies can help heal mild ulcers faster. Here are some effective ways to cure mouth ulcers naturally.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Rinse with salt water\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESalt has natural antibacterial and healing properties. Mix half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and swish it around your mouth for 15-30 seconds. This can reduce inflammation and prevent infection. Repeat 2-3 times daily for quick relief.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Apply honey directly\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHoney is known for its antimicrobial and soothing effects. Applying a small amount of organic honey on the ulcer 3-4 times a day can help reduce pain and speed up healing. According to the National Library of Medicine, honey is especially effective against minor oral wounds.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Use coconut oil\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECoconut oil contains lauric acid, which fights bacteria and reduces inflammation. Dab a bit of virgin coconut oil on the affected area multiple times a day. This also keeps the ulcer moisturised, preventing further irritation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Drink turmeric milk\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETurmeric contains curcumin, a natural anti-inflammatory compound. Drinking a warm glass of turmeric milk at night can reduce internal inflammation and support faster healing. You can also make a turmeric paste with a few drops of water and apply it topically.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Soothe with aloe vera\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAloe vera gel is known for its cooling and healing properties. Applying the gel directly to the ulcer 2-3 times a day can reduce pain and promote healing. As per the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dentistry, aloe vera helps regenerate tissue and reduce ulcer size.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Avoid spicy and acidic foods\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESpicy, citrusy, or acidic foods can aggravate ulcers and delay healing. Stick to soft, bland foods like curd, bananas, or boiled vegetables. Drink plenty of water and avoid irritants like tobacco and alcohol.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Maintain oral hygiene\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBrushing gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush and rinsing regularly helps prevent secondary infections. The Indian Dental Association (IDA) recommends using alcohol-free mouthwashes and avoiding harsh toothpaste with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which can trigger ulcers.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile mouth ulcers can be bothersome, natural remedies can offer quick and effective relief without medications. Keeping your immune system strong through proper nutrition, hydration, and stress management also helps prevent frequent outbreaks. If ulcers persist beyond two weeks or worsen, consult a healthcare professional.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003ELosing weight is not just about looking good, it's about feeling healthier, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and improving your overall quality of life. While diet plays a key role, incorporating a consistent and effective fitness routine is equally important. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly to maintain a healthy weight. But exercise is only effective when done right. In this article, we explore seven practical fitness tips to help you burn fat, boost metabolism, and stay motivated on your weight loss journey.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EFitness tips for weight loss\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key to losing weight through exercise is not intensity alone, it's consistency, balance, and listening to your body. Pairing the right workout routine with realistic goals can deliver sustainable results. As per the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), gradual and steady weight loss of 1-2 pounds per week is considered safe and effective. Here are seven effective fitness tips for weight loss.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Start with cardio to burn calories\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAerobic exercises like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming help burn a significant number of calories. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends 30-60 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio 5 times a week for optimal heart health and weight loss.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Incorporate strength training\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises (like squats, push-ups, and planks) builds lean muscle mass. More muscle means a higher resting metabolic rate, which helps you burn more calories even when you're not working out.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Try high-intensity interval training (HIIT)\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHIIT involves short bursts of intense activity followed by brief recovery periods. Research published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine states that HIIT is especially effective for fat loss and improving cardiovascular health in shorter workout durations.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4.

      "full_description": "\u003Cp\u003EWhile the importance of getting enough sleep is widely acknowledged, what's often overlooked is the potential harm of sleeping too much. Oversleeping, typically defined as regularly sleeping more than 9 hours per night, can be just as concerning as sleep deprivation. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Sleep Foundation, consistent oversleeping is associated with a variety of health issues including cognitive decline, mood disturbances, and metabolic problems. Sleep is essential for recovery, but balance is key. In this article, we explore the risks of oversleeping and why maintaining a healthy sleep schedule is crucial for overall wellbeing.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EOversleeping may indicate or lead to deeper health issues\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESleeping excessively could be a red flag for underlying medical conditions such as depression or thyroid disorders. More importantly, long sleep durations are linked to serious health risks. According to research by Harvard Medical School, oversleeping can negatively impact brain health, increase cardiovascular risk, and interfere with metabolic functions. Here are common health risks of oversleeping.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E1. Increased risk of heart disease\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiple studies, including one published in the European Heart Journal, have found that people who sleep over 9 hours regularly may face a greater risk of heart disease and stroke. Oversleeping has been linked to higher levels of inflammation and impaired circulation.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E2. Worsening mental health and depression\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOversleeping can be both a symptom and contributor to mental health issues like depression and anxiety. The National Sleep Foundation reports that irregular sleep patterns disrupt the body's internal clock, leading to mood instability and low energy levels throughout the day.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E3. Impaired brain function and memory\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExcessive sleep can impair cognitive functions such as memory, focus, and alertness. A study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease noted a link between long sleep duration and reduced brain volume, potentially accelerating age-related cognitive decline.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E4. Higher risk of obesity\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOversleeping may contribute to weight gain due to reduced physical activity and slower metabolism. People who sleep more than needed often have irregular eating patterns and are more likely to consume calorie-dense foods.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E5. Increased risk of type 2 diabetes\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA meta-analysis published in Diabetologia revealed that individuals who consistently sleep more than 9 hours a night have a higher risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, even when other risk factors are accounted for.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E6. Headaches and back pain\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOversleeping can lead to musculoskeletal discomfort, especially if you sleep in an awkward position or on a poor-quality mattress. It can also disrupt neurotransmitter balance in the brain, contributing to frequent headaches upon waking.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Ch3\u003E7. Shortened lifespan\u003C/h3\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESeveral large-scale studies suggest a correlation between long sleep duration and higher mortality rates. This does not imply causation but rather highlights the need for maintaining a consistent and appropriate sleep schedule for overall longevity.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOversleeping might feel like a luxury, but regularly exceeding the body's optimal rest needs can be harmful. It's essential to strike the right balance, typically 7-8 hours of quality sleep a night for most adults. If you're constantly sleeping more than that, consider consulting a healthcare professional to rule out underlying issues and recalibrate your sleep hygiene effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EDisclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.
